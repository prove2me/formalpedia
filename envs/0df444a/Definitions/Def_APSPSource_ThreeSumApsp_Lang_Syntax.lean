-- title:
--   A bounded imperative language with costed execution
-- statement:
--   The language has natural-number constants, local variables, integer addition, subtraction and multiplication, and memory loads. Statements include assignment, memory store, sequential composition, conditional branches, while loops, and procedure calls. A program is a list of procedure bodies. A state $\sigma=(\ell,\mu)$ contains integer-valued local variables and memory indexed by natural numbers; limits specify a word-magnitude bound, a memory-size bound, and a call-depth bound.
--
--   Expression costs count constants, variable accesses, arithmetic operations and loads:
--
--   $$
--   c(k)=c(x)=1,\qquad c(e_1\mathbin\circ e_2)=c(e_1)+c(e_2)+1,\qquad c(\operatorname{load}(e))=c(e)+1.
--   $$
--
--   Here $\circ$ is one of $+,-,\times$. Address safety means $0\le a<\mathrm{space}$; arithmetic-expression safety checks recursively that computed results fit the word bound. A separate state-boundedness predicate requires every local variable and memory value to fit that bound.
--
--   The inductive judgment $\operatorname{Exec}(\mathrm{lim},P,d,s,\sigma,\sigma',t)$ records a terminating execution of statement $s$ at call depth $d$ with exactly $t$ abstract steps. Sequential costs add; each test costs its two expression evaluations plus a comparison, followed by one control step. A call evaluates its arguments, starts a fresh local frame, runs a listed procedure within the depth limit, and returns local variable zero to the caller; its cost is the sum of argument costs plus two steps plus the callee's cost.
--
--   This provides the structured-language semantics used to verify routines before relating them to word-RAM machine code. Initial frames and initial memories place a supplied list at indices $0,1,\ldots$ and use zero elsewhere.

# The light language

A small imperative language with procedures and recursion, in which the paper's procedures can be
written almost as printed.  It is a proof device: a program of this language is compiled
(`compileProgram`) to the word RAM of the end statement, and the compiler is proved to keep results
and, up to a constant factor that depends on the program text only, step counts.

* A program is a finite piece of data: a list of procedure bodies.  It contains no Lean functions.
* The memory is an array of integers addressed by natural numbers.  Each running procedure has local
  variables 0, 1, 2, ….
* Arithmetic: +, −, ×.  There is no division.  Comparisons (<, =) occur as the tests of if and
  while.
* Every executed operation costs one step: each constant, variable, operation and load of an
  expression, each comparison, assignment, store, branch, call and return.
* A run is subject to limits: it forms no value of absolute value above `word`, touches no cell at
  an address ≥ `space`, and nests calls at most `depth` deep.  A run that would break a limit does
  not exist.

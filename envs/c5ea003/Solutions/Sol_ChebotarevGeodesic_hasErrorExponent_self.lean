# Chebotarev geodesic theorem: transfer, obstruction, and converse

A fourth research cycle built on `Shared.ChebotarevGeodesic`,
`Shared.ChebotarevGeodesicSharpness` and `Shared.ChebotarevGeodesicOptimal`.

The previous cycles produced the exponent calculus, the invertible-transform reduction
(the abstract form of the paper's reduction of the non-split case to the split case), the
structure theorem `exponentSet = Ici (optimalExponent)`, and sharpness examples.  This file
resolves, inside that framework, three of the conjectures that were left open:

* **C1 (transport of the whole exponent set).**  An invertible transform of a family of
  counting functions does not merely transfer one admissible exponent: it induces an
  *equality of joint exponent sets*, hence of joint optimal exponents
  (`jointExponentSet_transform`, `jointOptimalExponent_transform`).

* **C2 (a rank obstruction).**  The invertibility hypothesis is not an artefact of the proof.
  For a *singular* transform there are families whose transforms are exact and whose
  individual optimal exponents are arbitrarily large (`singular_transform_no_transfer`,
  `det_zero_no_transfer`), and in fact the transfer principle holds for a matrix `A`
  **iff** `det A ≠ 0` (`transfer_iff_det_ne_zero`).

* **C3 (log powers are invisible).**  `optimalExponent (M + K x^θ log^k x) M = θ` exactly
  (`optimalExponent_log_pow`): the `ε` in "`25/36 + ε`" hides log powers and nothing more.

* **C5 (a converse Chebotarev principle).**  If the class-counting functions dominate their
  main terms then the single aggregate estimate implies all the individual ones
  (`hasErrorExponent_of_nonneg_summands`, `chebotarev_converse`), and the positivity
  hypothesis cannot be dropped (`cancellation_counterexample`).

Supporting the above, the sharpness machinery of cycle 3 is upgraded from "growth for all
`x ≥ 1`" to "growth eventually", which is what genuine oscillation estimates provide.

`not_hasErrorExponent_of_growth` requires the lower bound `c x^β ≤ |π − M|` for *all* `x ≥ 1`.
Oscillation estimates only ever hold for large `x`; we upgrade the three sharpness statements
accordingly. -/

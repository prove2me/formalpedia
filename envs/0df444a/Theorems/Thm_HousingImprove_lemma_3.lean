-- title:
--   Lemma 3 — the output of HM-Improve is in the core of $H'$ (corrected: clause (iii) of an improvement; no loop at a sink)
-- statement:
--   Let $X$ be an allocation in the core of a housing market $H$ on a finite agent set and let $H'$ be a $p$-improvement of $H$. Let $(Y,R)$ be a state reached by a run of HM-Improve at which the iteration stops, and let $X_R$ be an allocation in the core of the submarket $H'_{R\cap N}$. Then the output $X'$ of HM-Improve (each $a\in R\cap N$ obtains $X_R(a)$, each $a\in N\setminus R$ obtains $Y(a)$, read as $p$ when $Y(a)=\tilde a$) is an allocation, and it lies in the core of $H'$.

--   Differences from the source:
--   - correction: a (p,q)-improvement satisfies (i) a ≺′_q b ⇔ a ≺_q b for a, b ≠ p, and (ii) a ≺_q p ⇒ a ≺′_q p (p.9) → IsImprovementAt adds clause (iii): p ≺′_q a ⇒ p ≺_q a for every a; reason: with (i) and (ii) only, Theorem 2 is false: N = {p, q, a}, p ranks q above a above p, a ranks q above a with p unacceptable, q has p and a incomparable above q in H and a above p above q in H′; the swap (p q) is in the core of H and every core allocation of H′ gives p the house of a or her own (proved in the verification file); for strict orders (iii) follows from (ii)
--   - reading: a (p,q)-improvement for agents p and q (q = p not excluded) → q ≠ p; reason: p.12 says the preferences of p remain unchanged; with q = p the theorem fails (N = {p, b}, p raises her own house above b's: the swap is in the core of H, the only core allocation of H′ gives p her own house)
--   - reading: a sequence of (p,q_i)-improvements for some k ∈ ℕ → a list of any length, k = 0 (H′ = H) included; reason: whether 0 ∈ ℕ is not fixed by the paper; for k = 0 every statement holds with X′ = X
--   - reading: Q = {q_i : X(q_i) ≺′_{q_i} p} for a series q_1, …, q_k of (p, q_i)-improvements (p.11); Algorithm 1, line 2: Q = {a ∈ N : ≺_a ≠ ≺′_a and X(a) ≺′_a p} → any Q with IsQChoice H H′ X p Q: every a ≠ p with ≺′_a ≠ ≺_a and X(a) ≺′_a p is in Q, and Q ⊆ Qset H′ X p = {a ≠ p : X(a) ≺′_a p}; reason: a series q_1, …, q_k must list every agent whose preferences changed and may list any other agent ≠ p (a trivial (p, a)-improvement), so these are exactly the sets the page allows; line 2's set is the smallest, Qset the largest
--   - generalization: the iteration starts only when X is not in the core of H′ (p.11, Algorithm 1, line 1) → every run from hmInit, whether or not X is in the core of H′; reason: the proofs of §4.2 never use that X is not in the core of H′; the source's runs are among the runs covered
--   - correction: (a, b) ∈ E is Y-augmenting if a ∈ V or Y(a) ≺_a b (p.11) → (a ∈ V and b ≠ a) or Y(a) ≺_a b; reason: (a, a) ∈ E for every a, so the literal definition puts a loop at every sink and no sub-allocation with a sink is stable, which makes Lemma 1 false; its proof and Step 2 use no loop
--   - encoding: H̃ keeps the preferences of H′ (with q̃ in the place of p for q) → tildeMarket keeps them among acceptable houses; houses unacceptable to an agent are below every acceptable one and mutually incomparable; reason: the acceptability graph G̃ is exactly the page's; every statement compares acceptable houses only
--   - encoding: the algorithm HM-Improve with its free choices → every chain of HMStep transitions from hmInit (HMReachable); reason: one transition per choice the page leaves free; each run of the page is such a chain
--   - encoding: an allocation is a set X ⊆ E with δ⁻_X(a) = δ⁺_X(a) = 1, and X is in the core if G^H_{X≺} is acyclic → Equiv.Perm N with every X(a) acceptable to a; the core as ¬TransGen of the X-augmenting relation at every agent; reason: same objects
--   - encoding: a housing market on a finite agent set N → [Fintype N]; reason: same instances
--   - encoding: the standing assumptions of §4.1: X in the core of H, H′ a p-improvement of H → hypotheses hX and hH; reason: same assumptions

/-- **Lemma 3** (Schlotter, Biró, Fleiner, arXiv:2110.06875v3, p.17): "The output of HM-Improve is an
allocation in the core of `H'`."

At the end of any run, for any allocation `X_R` in the core of the submarket `H'_{R∩N}` (Algorithm 1,
line 19), the output `X'` (p.13) exists as an allocation and lies in the core of `H'`.

`Q` is every set the page allows (`IsQChoice`): the agents of a series `q₁, …, q_k` of
`(p, q_i)`-improvements that prefer `p`'s house to `X(q_i)` in `H'`, Algorithm 1's
`{a : ≺_a ≠ ≺'_a, X(a) ≺'_a p}` included. -/

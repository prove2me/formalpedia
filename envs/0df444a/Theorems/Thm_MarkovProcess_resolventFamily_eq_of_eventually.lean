# Uniqueness for resolvents on bounded measurable functions

This file proves three elementary contraction principles for maps acting on bounded measurable
real functions. The first gives uniqueness for a bounded multiplicative perturbation equation.
The second propagates equality of two resolvent families from all sufficiently large shifts to
every positive shift by the resolvent identity. The third combines the first two principles.

Main results: `perturbed_unique`, `resolventFamily_eq_of_eventually`, and
`perturbed_eq_of_resolventFamilies`.

The operators are plain maps on functions; no Banach-space carrier or continuity is asserted.

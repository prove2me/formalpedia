# The √N Barrier for Structured-Set Factoring (abstract layer)

Companion to `SingularModuliCore.lean`.  That file shows that for a semiprime
`N = p q` and an integer polynomial `f` (e.g. a Hilbert class polynomial `H_D`)
the evaluation point `j₀` factors `N` **iff** its CRT coordinates lie in the
"exclusive-or" set

    G = { (a,b) : a ∈ R_p, b ∉ R_q } ∪ { (a,b) : a ∉ R_p, b ∈ R_q },

where `R_m` is the root set of `f` mod `m`.  Here we forget the polynomial
entirely and analyse this configuration for *arbitrary* subsets
`R_p ⊆ ZMod p`, `R_q ⊆ ZMod q` with `|R_p|, |R_q| ≤ d`.  This is the honest
level of generality: the only feature of singular moduli the method exploits is
that `H_D` has few roots (`h(D) = deg H_D`) modulo each prime.

Main results.

* `SqrtBarrier.card_goodPairs` — the exact count `r_p (q - r_q) + (p - r_p) r_q`.
* `SqrtBarrier.expectedTrials_ge` — **lower bound**: for balanced primes
  (`p ≤ q ≤ 2p`) and root counts `≤ d`, the expected number of uniformly random
  evaluation points before a factor is found is at least `√N / (3 d)`.
* `SqrtBarrier.expectedTrials_le` — **matching upper bound**: if both root
  counts equal `h ≥ 1` and `4h ≤ p`, the expectation is at most `√N / h`.
  Hence the method is `Θ(√N / h)` — it *works*, and it is *exponential in the
  bit size of N*, quantified in `SqrtBarrier.expectedTrials_ge_two_pow`.
* `SqrtBarrier.exists_bad_shift` and `SqrtBarrier.exists_bad_shift_of_small`
  — **the circularity barrier**, in an adversarial (not merely probabilistic)
  form: a translation-averaging argument shows that *any* fixed query set of
  size below `√N / (3 d)` is defeated by some translate of the structured set.
  Knowing that the target set is "structured" is worth nothing unless one knows
  *where* it is, which is exactly the information `p` encodes.

Note on the informal claim `√N/(4h)` in the source note: the exact count below
gives expectation `pq / (h (p + q - 2h))`, i.e. `≈ √N / (2h)` for balanced
primes, not `√N/(4h)`.  The heuristic there double-counts the two primes; the
corrected constant is proved in `expectedTrials_balanced_eq`.

/-! ## Random search: a rigorous success-probability bound

`expectedTrials` above is the mean of the geometric distribution.  To avoid
leaning on that interpretation, this section proves the corresponding statement
purely by counting: among all `N^T` sequences of `T` independent uniform
evaluation points, the proportion on which *every* point fails is
`(1 - |G|/N)^T`, and hence the success probability of a `T`-point random search
is at most `3 d T / √N`.  Below `√N/(6d)` points it is less than one half. -/

/-- `handleClientValue` publishes only as an elected leader that has accepted its own last publication, only in its
current term, only with a version above the last published one, only reconfiguring when the last accepted
configuration is committed, and only to a configuration in which its join votes are a quorum. The caller's contract
that the new state keeps the committed configuration (`clientValueContract`) is neither checked nor stated. -/

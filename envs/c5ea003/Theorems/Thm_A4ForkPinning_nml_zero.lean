# Fork information: the pinned / flat / leaking trichotomy

Formal core of the *A4-FORK-PINNING* experiment (paper 75, experiment 410).

A **fork** attached to a number field is a binary observable `F` of the Frobenius
class of a prime `p`; a **dial** is a residue datum `y = p mod m`.  The
experiment measures the mutual information `I(y ; F)` and observes exactly three
regimes:

* **pinned**   — `F` is a function of `y`, and `I = H(F)` is maximal;
* **flat**     — `F` is independent of `y`, and `I = 0`;
* **leaking**  — `F` is a *thinning* of a pinned event, and `0 < I < H(F)`,
  with the exact closed form `I = H(pq) - p·H(q)`.

This file builds the (bit-valued) information calculus needed to state and prove
those three laws for an arbitrary finite dial:

* `A4ForkPinning.info_of_pinned`   — pinned forks realise `I = H(F)`;
* `A4ForkPinning.info_of_flat`     — flat forks realise `I = 0`;
* `A4ForkPinning.info_leak`        — the **exact leakage law** `I = H(pq) - p·H(q)`;
* `A4ForkPinning.info_leak_strict` — leakage is strictly between the two regimes;
* `A4ForkPinning.info_trichotomy`  — `0 ≤ I ≤ H(F)`, with `I = 0` iff the fork is
  flat and `I = H(F)` iff the fork is pinned (strict Jensen in both directions).

All entropies are measured in **bits** (`negMulLog` divided by `log 2`).

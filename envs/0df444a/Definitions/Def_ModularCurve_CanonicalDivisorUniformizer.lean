-- title:
--   Chosen uniformizer at a place and its order
-- statement:
--   The setting is a field extension $F/K$ of fields and a place $v : \mathrm{Place}\ K\ F$, i.e. (in the project's sense) a valuation subring $\mathcal{O}_v \subseteq F$ containing $\mathrm{algebraMap}\ K\ F$ of all of $K$, distinct from $F$ itself, and a principal ideal ring; such a ring is then a discrete valuation ring, $v.\mathrm{ord}$ is the associated normalised additive valuation on $F$ (minus the logarithm of the $\mathfrak{m}_v$-adic valuation, with the convention $v.\mathrm{ord}\,0 = 0$), and $v.\mathrm{dCoord} \in \Omega[F\,\vert\,K]$ is the Kähler differential of a uniformizer at $v$.
--
--   [`AlgebraicCurve.Place.uniformizer`](../def/ModularCurve_CanonicalDivisor.html#L19) makes this choice available as a public definition: it is the element of $F$ obtained by coercing the irreducible element of $\mathcal{O}_v$ whose existence is given by the discrete valuation ring structure on $\mathcal{O}_v$. Thus it is a chosen generator of the maximal ideal, canonical only up to a unit. Three facts accompany it. `ord_uniformizer` states $v.\mathrm{ord}(\pi_v) = 1$, so the chosen element does have order exactly one at $v$; it follows from the computation of $\mathrm{ord}$ on the image of an irreducible element of $\mathcal{O}_v$. `uniformizer_ne_zero` states $\pi_v \neq 0$ in $F$, obtained from the previous statement together with $v.\mathrm{ord}\,0 = 0$. Finally `dCoord_eq` identifies the differential used for the canonical-divisor formalism with the differential of this element: $v.\mathrm{dCoord} = D_{K/F}(\pi_v)$ in the module of Kähler differentials $\Omega[F\,\vert\,K]$, where $D$ is Mathlib's universal derivation. The point of the module is therefore to expose, under a stable name and with its basic properties, the same chosen irreducible element that is used privately in the definition of `dCoord`, so that the differential coefficient and order-of-differential constructions can be computed against an explicit local parameter.
--
--   **Relation to Mathlib.** The notion of `Place` of $F/K$ as a valuation subring containing $K$, proper and principal, together with its `ord`, is the project's own; the existence of an irreducible element and the module of Kähler differentials $\Omega[F\,\vert\,K]$ with its universal derivation `KaehlerDifferential.D` are taken from Mathlib.
--
--   **Where it is used.** These declarations serve the divisor-theoretic treatment of curves, in particular of modular curves, where orders of functions and of differentials at a place are computed against a local parameter; they underlie the definitions of the differential coefficient, the order of a differential and hence of the canonical divisor.

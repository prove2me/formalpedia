# The prime cyclic order: a closed form for the type-pair channel

The exact-value files compute the type-pair channel `Ipair n` for a finite list of
cyclic orders.  This file closes the *prime* case in complete generality: for
every prime `p` the channel of the cyclic order `C p` is

  `Ipair p = log₂ p - (p-1)(2p-1)/p² · log₂ (p-1) + (p-1)(p-2)/p² · log₂ (p-2)`.

(`Ipair_prime`; the two exact values `Ipair 3` and `Ipair 5` recorded in
`CyclicTypeChannelCRT.lean` are the instances `p = 3, 5`.)

Two consequences:

* `Ipair_prime_lt_one`: every **odd** prime order is *strictly below* the one-bit
  binary-fork cap, so among prime cyclic orders the cap is attained exactly at
  `p = 2` (`Ipair_prime_eq_one_iff`).  This upgrades the isolated computations
  `Ipair 3 < 1`, `Ipair 5 < 1` to an infinite statement and shows that the
  above-cap phenomenon of `C₄, C₆, C₁₀, C₁₂, C₁₆` is genuinely a *composite*
  phenomenon: a prime cyclic order has only two splitting types, and its fork is
  exactly the binary fork that papers 72–74 capped.
* `above_cap_imp_not_prime`: breaking the cap forces the cyclic order to be
  composite.

`Ipair 3` and `Ipair 5` were computed in `CyclicTypeChannelCRT.lean` by explicit
enumeration of the `9`- and `25`-element boxes.  Re-deriving them from the general
prime formula is an independent check of the closed form. -/

# The fixed-point variety of an elementary cellular automaton

This file sets up the algebraic-geometry style framework in which the
"ECA complexity = dimension of the fixed-point variety" conjecture can be
*tested*, building directly on the Boolean local rules of
`Novelty.CellularAutomataAlgebraicGeometry`.

A cyclic configuration of size `n` is a function `ZMod n → ZMod 2`, i.e. a point
of the affine space `𝔸ⁿ_{𝔽₂}` (for `n = 0` this degenerates to the bi-infinite
configuration space `ℤ → ZMod 2`, which is why all statements below are stated
uniformly over `ZMod n`).  The *fixed-point variety* of Wolfram rule `rule` is

  `V(rule, n) = { s : ZMod n → ZMod 2 | step rule s = s }`,

the `𝔽₂`-points of the zero locus of the `n` cubic polynomials
`fᵣ(s_{i-1}, s_i, s_{i+1}) - s_i`.

## Main results

* `localRuleZ_ofBool` — the `ZMod 2`-valued local rule agrees with the Boolean
  local rule of the catalog file, so this is genuinely the same dynamics.
* `mem_fixedSet_iff` — pointwise description of the fixed-point variety.
* `fixedSet_rotate` — the variety is invariant under the shift, i.e. it is a
  cyclic subshift of finite type, not an arbitrary subset.
* `IsAdditive.fixedSubmodule` — for an *additive* rule the variety really is a
  linear subspace, so a dimension `HasFixedDim` is defined.
* `rule204_hasFixedDim`, `rule204_fixedSet_univ` — the identity rule (Wolfram
  class 1/2) attains the maximal dimension `n`.
* `rule0_hasFixedDim_zero` — the null rule has dimension `0`.
* `hasFixedDim_unique` — the dimension, when it exists, is well defined.

/-! ### Periodicity transfer on the ring

Many fixed-point loci are governed by a spatial period `p`; when `p` is
invertible modulo the ring size the configuration is forced to be constant.
These generic lemmas are used for `p = 2` and `p = 3` below. -/

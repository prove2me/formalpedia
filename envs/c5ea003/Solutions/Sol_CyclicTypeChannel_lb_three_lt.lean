# The cyclic splitting-type channel

A self-contained, formally verified account of the *splitting-type channel* of a
cyclic field extension.

For a prime `f` the Galois group of `ℚ(ζ_f)/ℚ` is `(ℤ/f)ˣ ≅ C n` with `n = f - 1`.
Writing an unramified prime `p` as `g ^ a` for a fixed generator `g`, the residue
degree (= the order of the Frobenius `p mod f`) is

  `T(p) = ord_f(p) = n / gcd(a, n)`.

This file develops:

* a general finite (counting) Shannon-entropy framework `uEnt`, its conditional
  version `condEnt` and the mutual information `mutInfo`;
* the general structural facts: the Shannon form of `uEnt`, non-negativity, the
  `log₂ |s|` cap, and the *data-processing* inequality for deterministic
  coarsenings;
* the group-theoretic grounding: `orderOf (g ^ a) = ordType n a` for a generator
  `g` of a cyclic group of order `n`, and the exact type-count law
  `#{a : ordType n a = d} = φ d`;
* exact closed-form evaluations of the type channel and of the *type-pair
  channel* of a semiprime for `n = 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 16`, culminating in the
  headline fact that the pair channel of `C₄` and `C₆` carries strictly more
  than one bit.

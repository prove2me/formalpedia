# The Berggren / Price tree of primitive Pythagorean triples: nodes, letters, blindness

This file develops the ternary Berggren tree in its Price coordinates: nodes are
pairs `(m, n)` with `m > n ≥ 1`, `gcd m n = 1` and `m + n` odd, the root is `(2,1)`,
and the three children of `(m, n)` are

* `A : (m, n) ↦ (2m - n, m)`,
* `B : (m, n) ↦ (2m + n, m)`,
* `C : (m, n) ↦ (m + 2n, n)`.

The triple attached to a node is `(m² - n², 2mn, m² + n²)`.

Main results.

* `isNode_childA/B/C`, `parent_*` : the tree is well defined and every non-root node
  has a unique parent, given by the *ascent letter* `letterOf`.
* `isNode.inTree` : **coverage** — every node in the arithmetic sense is reachable
  from the root `(2,1)`; the letter of a node is exactly the branch taken by its parent.
* `letterOf_blind_of_residue` : **residue dials are blind.**  For *every* modulus
  `M ≥ 1` and every scale `t ≥ 1` there are three nodes with hypotenuses all
  congruent to `1 mod M` and with the three distinct ascent letters.  Hence no
  function of `hyp mod M` computes the ascent letter (`residue_dial_letterBlind`),
  in particular no Gauss-sum style dial on `N mod 720720`.
* `letterOf_blind_of_magnitude` : **magnitude mirrors are blind.**  There is an
  infinite family of hypotenuses realised by two different nodes with *different*
  letters, e.g. `505 = 19² + 12² = 21² + 8² = 5 · 101`.  Hence no function of the
  hypotenuse itself — monotone or not — computes the ascent letter
  (`magnitude_probe_letterBlind`).
* `parityProfile_constant` : structural sensors (leg parities, Lorentz form) are
  *exactly* constant on the tree, so they are blind for trivial reasons.

/-! ### Branching base: the tree is exactly ternary

The ascent letter of a child names the branch that produced it, so the three
children of a node are pairwise distinct and each child remembers its parent.
Consequently the depth-`h` descendant set of any node has exactly `3 ^ h`
elements: the branching base of the Berggren/Price tree is pinned at `3`.

# The Burnside Moment Hierarchy, part II: symmetric groups, kernels and Bell numbers

This file continues `Logic.MomentHierarchy`. Instantiating the moment identity
`∑_{g ∈ G} |X^g|^k = #((X^k)/G) · |G|` at the full symmetric group `Sym X` turns the
hierarchy into the moment sequence of the number of fixed points of a uniformly random
permutation. The orbits of `Sym X` on `k`-tuples are classified by kernel partitions, so
for `k ≤ |X|` the `k`-th level counts set partitions of a `k`-element set, and the
Cauchy–Schwarz inequality of part I becomes log-convexity of the Bell sequence.

/-! ## Cycle 4: instantiation at the symmetric group

For the natural action of `Equiv.Perm X` on a finite `X` the hierarchy becomes the
moment sequence of the number of fixed points of a uniformly random permutation. The
action is transitive and 2-transitive, so the first two moments are `1` and `2` — the
first two Bell numbers, i.e. the first two moments of a Poisson(1) variable. -/

/-! ## Cycle 5: kernels, set partitions and log-convexity of the Bell sequence

The hierarchy for the *full* symmetric group is the sharpest instance: two `k`-tuples in
`X` lie in the same `Sym X`-orbit exactly when they have the same **kernel partition**
(`perm_orbit_iff_ker`). Hence, as soon as `k ≤ |X|`, the `k`-th level of the hierarchy
counts set partitions of a `k`-element set:
`#((X^k)/Sym X) = #(Setoid (Fin k))` (`orbits_perm_eq_card_setoid`).

Two consequences follow with no extra work:

* the **Poisson moment theorem** `∑_{σ ∈ Sym X} |fix σ|^k = P(k) · n!` for `k ≤ n`,
  where `P(k)` is the number of set partitions of a `k`-set (the `k`-th Bell number);
* the **log-convexity of the Bell sequence** `P(k+1)^2 ≤ P(k) · P(k+2)`, obtained by
  transporting the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality for fixed-point moments through the
  kernel classification. -/

# Euler products from RLHF: the zeta policy on smooth-number response spaces

We instantiate the Gibbs variational principle of `NumberTheory.RLHFGibbsVariational`
with an arithmetic reward model.  The response space is the set of `{p, q}`-smooth
integers `p^a q^b` with bounded exponents, the SFT reference is uniform, and the reward is
the logarithmic (Dirichlet) reward `r(n) = -β s log n`.

The optimal (Gibbs) policy is then the **truncated zeta distribution** `π(n) ∝ n^{-s}`, and
the number-theoretic Euler product manifests itself as a *statistical independence* of the
prime exponents under the aligned policy, together with an *additive* decomposition of the
RLHF free energy over primes.

Main results:

* `RLHF.zeta_partition_factorizes` — Euler factorization of the normalizing constant.
* `RLHF.gibbs_zeta_policy` — the optimal RLHF policy is exactly `n^{-s} / ∑ n^{-s}`.
* `RLHF.gibbs_zeta_independent` — under the optimal policy the prime exponents are
  independent (the policy is a product of two truncated geometric laws).
* `RLHF.freeEnergy_euler_additive` — the RLHF free energy splits additively over the primes.
* `RLHF.smoothVal_injective` — unique factorization: the response space really is a set of
  distinct integers.
* `RLHF.euler_factor_tsum` — removing the exponent cutoff, the local partition function is
  the classical Euler factor `(1 - p^{-s})⁻¹`.

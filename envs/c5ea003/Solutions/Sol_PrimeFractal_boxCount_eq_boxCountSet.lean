# Refined box-counting: a universal ceiling and a logarithmic defect

Two refinements of `NumberTheory.PrimeFractalBoxDimension`.

## 1. A universal ceiling: no subset of `ℝ` can have box dimension `> 1`

`boxCountSet S m` counts the boxes of size `1/m` meeting a set `S ⊆ ℝ`.  For any
`S` contained in a bounded interval, `boxCountSet_le` gives
`boxCountSet S m ≤ ⌊c m⌋ + 1`, whence `boxDim_le_one_of_bounded`:

  for every `ε > 0`, eventually `log (boxCountSet S m) / log m ≤ 1 + ε`.

This settles the mission's `1 + ε` conjecture *structurally*: whatever the
twin primes do, a subset of the line has box dimension at most `1`.  The value
`ε = 0` is not an accident of the primes; it is forced by the ambient
dimension.  (The Hausdorff dimension is likewise `≤ 1`, and for the primes it
is in fact `0`.)

## 2. A logarithmic defect: `boxCount m = Θ(m / log m)`, not `Θ(m)`

Chebyshev's *upper* bound (from Mathlib) plus a splitting of the primes at `m`
gives `eventually_boxCount_le`: `boxCount m ≤ 5 m / log m`.  Hence
`tendsto_boxCount_div_self`: `boxCount m / m → 0`.  So although the box
dimension is exactly `1`, the prime fractal has *zero one-dimensional Minkowski
content*: it is a dimension-`1` set that occupies a vanishing fraction of the
boxes a genuine interval would occupy.  This is the precise sense in which the
primes "fill out a line" — only up to a logarithmic factor, and they carry no
length at all.

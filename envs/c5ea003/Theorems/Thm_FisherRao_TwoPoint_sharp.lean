# The `L¹` bound integrates to a Fisher–Rao length bound

This file proves the main theorem `l1_le_fisherRao_length`: along any smooth
curve of (strictly positive) probability vectors, the `L¹` distance between the
endpoints is bounded by the Fisher–Rao length of the curve.

The infinitesimal statement is a Cauchy–Schwarz inequality on the simplex,

  `∑ᵢ |vᵢ| = ∑ᵢ (|vᵢ| / √pᵢ) · √pᵢ ≤ √(∑ᵢ vᵢ²/pᵢ) · √(∑ᵢ pᵢ) = √(∑ᵢ vᵢ²/pᵢ)`,

i.e. the `L¹` speed of a curve of probability vectors never exceeds its
Fisher–Rao speed.  Integrating this pointwise bound with the fundamental theorem
of calculus turns it into the global length bound.

## Main definitions

* `l1Dist`            — the `L¹` distance `∑ᵢ |pᵢ - qᵢ|` (twice total variation)
* `fisherRaoSpeed`    — `√(∑ᵢ vᵢ² / pᵢ)`, the Fisher–Rao norm of a tangent vector
* `fisherRaoLength`   — the integral of the Fisher–Rao speed along a curve

## Main results

* `l1_speed_le_fisherRaoSpeed` — the infinitesimal (Cauchy–Schwarz) bound
* `l1_le_fisherRao_length`     — the integrated length bound (main theorem)
* `l1_le_fisherRao_length_uIcc`— localized version, hypotheses only on `[a,b]`
* `tv_le_half_fisherRao_length`— total variation form of the main theorem
* `fisherRaoSpeed_eq_two_mul_sqrtSpeed` — Fisher–Rao speed is twice the
  Euclidean speed of the square-root (sphere) embedding
* `TwoPoint.fisherRaoLength_eq_arcsin`, `TwoPoint.l1_lt_fisherRaoLength`,
  `TwoPoint.sharp` — an exactly solvable family showing the inequality is
  strict but that the constant `1` is optimal
* `fisherRao_sq_tensor`, `fisherRaoSpeed_tensor` — Pythagorean tensorization
* `abs_sub_event_le_half_fisherRao_length` — no event's probability moves by
  more than half the length
* `sqrt_chord_le_half_fisherRao_length` — the sharper spherical chord bound
* `one_sub_bhattacharyya_le_sq_fisherRao_length` — Hellinger/Bhattacharyya form
* `l1Dist_le_two_mul_sqrt_one_sub_bhattacharyya_sq`,
  `l1Dist_le_sum_arccos_bhattacharyya` — the smoothness-free discrete analogue

The Fisher–Rao metric is, up to the factor `4`, the Euclidean metric pulled back
along `p ↦ √p`.  Concretely, if `pᵢ` moves with velocity `vᵢ`, then `√pᵢ` moves
with velocity `vᵢ / (2√pᵢ)`, and hence `∑ᵢ (d/dt √pᵢ)² = ¼ ∑ᵢ vᵢ²/pᵢ`. -/





/-! ## Sharpness: an explicit two-point family

To show that the constant `1` in `l1_le_fisherRao_length` cannot be improved we
compute both sides exactly for the curve

  `t ↦ ((1 + r·sin t)/2, (1 - r·sin t)/2)`,  `t ∈ [0, π/2]`,  `0 ≤ r < 1`,

in the interior of the 1-dimensional simplex.  Its `L¹` displacement is `r`
while its Fisher–Rao length is `arcsin r`; the ratio tends to `1` as `r → 0`,
and is `> 1` for every `r ∈ (0,1)` (so the inequality is always strict for
non-constant curves in this family). -/

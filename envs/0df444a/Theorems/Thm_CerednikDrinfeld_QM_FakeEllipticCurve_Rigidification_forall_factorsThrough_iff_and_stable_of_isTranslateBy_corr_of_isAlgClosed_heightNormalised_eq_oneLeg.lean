-- title:
--   Extra-level transport along an e_γ-translate, and stability detection
-- statement:
--   The setting is the one used throughout the Čerednik–Drinfeld comparison for fake elliptic curves, and is fixed by the following groups of data and hypotheses.
--
--   *Local base.* Primes $r$ and $\bar r$ with $\bar r \neq r$, and a non-zero level $N$ with $N$ squarefree and divisible by neither $r$ nor $\bar r$. A characteristic-zero discrete valuation domain $\mathcal O$ with irreducible element $\pi$, $\pi$-adically complete, whose residue ring $\mathcal O/\pi$ has exactly $r$ elements and for which $(r) = (\pi)$; $K_0$ is a characteristic-zero fraction field of $\mathcal O$. A characteristic-zero domain $Onr$ over $\mathcal O$ with an $\mathcal O$-automorphism $Fr$, such that $Onr$ is $\pi$-adically complete, $(\pi Onr)$ is maximal, every element of $Onr$ satisfies a monic polynomial over $\mathcal O$ modulo $\pi$ (`hOnr_alg`), every monic polynomial of positive degree over $Onr$ has a root modulo $\pi$ (`hOnr_closed`), and $Fr(x) \equiv x^r \pmod{\pi}$ (`hFr`). A homomorphism $vdet : \mathrm{GL}_2(K_0) \to \mathbb Z$ (written multiplicatively) which, by `hvdet`, records the $\pi$-adic valuation of the determinant up to units of $\mathcal O$.
--
--   *Moduli data.* An indefinite quaternion algebra $\mathbb H[\mathbb Q,a,b]$ ramified exactly at $r$ and $\bar r$, with maximal order $\Lambda$; a scheme $\mathcal X$ over $\operatorname{Spec}\mathcal O$ with point-assignment $pt$ which is a coarse moduli space for fake elliptic curves of level $N$ (`h𝒳`); an auxiliary level $n \geq 3$ coprime to $N$ and divisible by neither $r$ nor $\bar r$, a fine moduli space $M$ over $\operatorname{Spec}\mathcal O$ with $ptF$ (`hM`), a group $G$ acting on $M$ by $\rho$ with labels $\chi$ in $\Lambda$ realising the level-$n$ twists (`hρ`), and a forgetful morphism $p : M \to \mathcal X$ over the base, invariant under $\rho$ and compatible with the two point-assignments (`hp`, `hρp`, `hp_pt`). Hecke correspondences $\mathcal Y_\ell$ with structure morphisms $g_\ell$ and point-assignments $ptT$ making them coarse moduli spaces for curves with extra level $\ell$ (`h𝒴`), together with the two degeneracy maps $d_0,d_1$ to $\mathcal X$ and their compatibilities (`hd₀f`, `hd₁f`, `hd₀`, `hd₁`), and Atkin–Lehner morphisms $ar$, $arbar$ of $\mathcal X$ over the base realising the Atkin–Lehner quotients at $r$ and at $\bar r$ (`har`, `harbar`).
--
--   *Definite side and the group $\tilde\Gamma$.* A definite quaternion algebra $\mathbb H[\mathbb Q,a_1,b_1]$ ramified exactly at $\bar r$, a maximal order $\Lambda_1$, an Eichler order $R_1$ of level $N$ contained in $\Lambda_1$, an adelic element $n_1$ in the prime Hecke set of $R_1$ at $r$ such that the intersection order $\mathrm{meetOrder}\,R_1\,n_1$ is Eichler of level $Nr$, an injective $\mathbb Q$-algebra embedding $\iota_0$ of $\mathbb H[\mathbb Q,a_1,b_1]$ into $M_2(K_0)$, and the place $v$ of $\mathbb Q$ above $r$. The subgroup $\Gamma t$ is characterised by `hΓt` as the group of units of $\mathbb H[\mathbb Q,a_1,b_1]$ integral at all places away from $v$ with respect to $R_1$. Elements $s_\ell$ and adelic elements $sf_\ell$ are given for each prime $\ell \neq r,\bar r$, subject to the four clauses of `hs` (local agreement away from $r$, triviality at $r$, membership of the relevant Hecke or level-Hecke set, and reduced norm $\ell$), with $\Gamma t_\ell$ the intersection of $\Gamma t$ with its conjugate by $s_\ell$ (`hΓtℓ`); a unit $wbar$ of reduced norm $\bar r$ normalising $\Gamma t$ (`hwbar`). Finally $\Lambda$ contains the rational integers (`hΛℤ`), and `coord` is an order coordinate for $\Lambda$ at $r$ (`hcoord`).
--
--   *Special fibre.* A fake elliptic curve $A_0$ of level $N$ over $Onr/\pi$, a formal $\mathcal O_D$-module $X_0$ over $Onr/\pi$ of height $4$ (`hX₀`), formal coordinates $\theta_0$ of dimension $2$ along the unit section of $A_0$ exhibiting $A_0$ as a formal module via `coord`, $X_0$, $\theta_0$ (`hA₀`), and families $e,e'$ of endomorphisms of $A_0$ indexed by $\Gamma t$, with $e\gamma$ over the base (`he`) and degrees $\deg$. The hypotheses `hE1`, `hE1mul`, `hE1sc`, `hE1'`, `hE2`, `hE3`, `hE4` (summarised here) state respectively that each $e\gamma$ is one half of an isogeny pair of degree $r^{\deg\gamma}$ preserving the level-$N$ structure; that $\gamma \mapsto e\gamma$ is multiplicative up to $r$-power multiplications; that rational integral scalars act as such up to $r$-powers; that only scalars in $\Gamma t$ give multiplications; that for any injective realisation of the centraliser of the $X_0$-action and $\varpi$ by $2\times2$ matrices over $K_0$ there is $g \in \mathrm{GL}_2(K_0)$ such that each $e\gamma$ is induced on formal coordinates by an element of that centraliser whose matrix is an $r$-power multiple of $g\,\iota_0(\gamma)\,g^{-1}$; that the $\Gamma t$-action on a full level-$n$ structure $P_0$ is labelled by elements of $\Lambda$ multiplicatively modulo $n$; and that on any base change of $A_0$ to an algebraically closed field every $r$-power isogeny self-map preserving the level comes from some $e\gamma$ up to $r$-power multiplications. A further suborder $R_2$ of $R_1$ with $r$-power denominators (`hR₂`, `hR₂o`, `hR₂r`), endomorphisms $\hat e$ of $A_0$ indexed by $R_2$ over the base (`hê`), and the hypotheses `hE5a`–`hE5e` stating that $\hat e$ is additive, $\Lambda$-equivariant and level-preserving, unital, multiplicative, compatible with integers, compatible with conjugation through the reduced norm, compatible with $e$ on $r$-power multiples of elements of $\Gamma t$, and jointly realised with $e$ by the same matrix conjugation as in `hE2`.
--
--   *Formal moduli and the Deligne datum.* A ring map $\iota$ from $\mathbb Z_{r^2}$-Witt vectors into $Onr$, a special formal $\mathcal O_D$-module $\Phi$ of height $4$ over $Onr/(r)$ (`hΦ`, `hΦ4`), a moduli package $MD$ over $Onr$ which is a Zariski sheaf (`hMD`), a comparison $\eta$ from rigidified data to $MD$ whose three clauses (`hη`) assert that $\eta$ separates admissible rigidifications exactly up to isomorphism, is natural in the base ring, and is locally surjective on a Zariski cover, and an injective matrix realisation $E_0$ of the centraliser attached to $\Phi$ with bounded denominators (`hE₀`). The natural transformation $eD$ identifies the functor of $G$-points of $MD$ with the product of the functor corepresented by $Onr$ and the Deligne-datum functor $\Omega(K_0,\pi)$, with `hnatD` (naturality), `hbijD` (bijectivity), `hfstD` (first component is the structure map $\psi$), `hGLD` (the $\mathrm{GL}_2(K_0)$-action on $G$-points corresponds to the twisted action `OmegaNr.IsTwistedAct`), `hPiD` and `hPiexD` ($\pi$-translation corresponds to twisting the first component by $Fr$, and exists). A ring map $\kappa$ compatible with the two reductions (`hκ`) and an isogeny $\beta_0$ of height $4n_0$ from $\Phi$ to the $\kappa$-base change of $X_0$ (`hβ₀`). A full level-$n$ structure $P_0$ on $A_0$. Atkin–Lehner data at $\bar r$ on the special fibre: a curve $A_{0w}$, morphisms $aw,aw',bw,bw'$ over the base, an integer $kw$, the hypotheses `hALw` (Atkin–Lehner quotient at $\bar r$ via $aw,aw'$), `hBSw` and `hBSwlev` ($bw$ is one half of an isogeny pair of degree $r^{kw}$ preserving the level), and `hJOINTw` (a single $g$ realising simultaneously all $e\gamma$ as in `hE2` and the composite $aw$ followed by $bw$ as an $r$-power multiple of $g\,\iota_0(wbar)\,g^{-1}$).
--
--   *The comparison $\Xi$.* A map $\Xi$ sending a rigidified curve over a Noetherian $\mathcal O$-algebra $B$ with $\pi$ nilpotent to a $G$-point of $MD$, subject to `hΞleg` (its first component is an $Fr$-twist of $\psi$ when $B$ is connected), `hΞnat` (compatibility with pullback of rigidifications), `hΞiso` (invariance under isomorphisms of rigidified curves matched by the displayed comparison data) and `hΞdef` (its explicit description through $\eta$ and a rigidified object transported from $\theta_0$, $\kappa$, $\beta_0$ with exponent $j \leq 1$). A fixed $g_0 \in \mathrm{GL}_2(K_0)$ with: `heqΓ` and `heqW`, stating that translation of a rigidification by $e\gamma$, respectively passage to the Atkin–Lehner quotient at $\bar r$ with the displayed comparison data, corresponds under $\Xi$ to the action of an $r$-power multiple of $g_0\iota_0(\gamma)g_0^{-1}$, respectively of $g_0\iota_0(wbar)g_0^{-1}$; `hK1`–`hK4`, stating that the assignment sending $(E,\varrho)$ with normalised leg to the pair $(\psi,P)$ determined by $eD \circ \Xi$ twisted by $g_0^{-1}$ is surjective, injective up to isomorphism of rigidified curves, compatible with base change, and liftable along surjections with square-zero-type kernels; `hC0e` and `hC0u`, the existence and uniqueness on points of the normalised level-$n$ transport of $P_0$ along a rigidification; the transformation $\Theta f$ into the nilpotent points of $M$ with `hnat` (naturality), `hG` ($G$-equivariance), `hC2` and `hC2c` (its value is the fine moduli point of the transported level structure, and composing with $p$ gives the coarse moduli point); a homomorphism $\theta t : \Gamma t \to G$; and `hC3`, the transport clause: for a connected such $B$ and a point $(\psi,P)$ arising from $(E,\varrho)$, for $\gamma \in \Gamma t$ and any $(\psi',P')$ obtained from $(\psi,P)$ by the twisted action of $\iota_0(\gamma)$, there is a rigidification $\varrho'$ of the same $E$ with normalised leg realising $(\psi',P')$, whose level-$n$ transport differs from that of $\varrho$ by the twist $\chi(\theta t\,\gamma)$, and such that for every prime $\ell \neq r$ invertible in $B$ and every extra level $K_0$ of level $\ell$ on $A_0$ stable under $e\gamma$, any two extra levels of $E$ transported from $K_0$ along $\varrho$ and along $\varrho'$ cut out the same points of $E$.
--
--   *The situation considered.* An algebraically closed field $k$ which is an $\mathcal O$-algebra with $\pi$ nilpotent, an $\mathcal O$-algebra map $\psi : Onr \to k$, Deligne data $P, P'$ over $k$, fake elliptic curves $E, E'$ of level $N$ over $k$ with rigidifications $\varrho$, $\varrho'$ relative to the $Fr$-twist of $\psi$ by $-vdet(g_0)$, both having normalised leg and mapping under $eD \circ \Xi$, twisted by $g_0^{-1}$, to $(\psi,P)$ and $(\psi,P')$ respectively (`hΞψ`, `hev`, `hΞψ'`, `hev'`); an isomorphism $i : E \cong E'$ over $k$ compatible with the group laws, the $\Lambda$-actions and the level-$N$ structures (`hvia`); an element $\gamma$ of $\Gamma t$; a third rigidification $\varrho''$ of $E$ with normalised leg and image $(\psi,P')$ (`hev''`); the twisted-action relation $htw$ carrying $(\psi,P)$ to $(\psi,P')$ by $\iota_0(\gamma)$; the relation $htr$ that $\varrho''$ is the $e\gamma$-translate of $\varrho$; and `hcorr`, the explicit comparison of $\varrho''$ with $\varrho'$ along $i$ given by morphisms $ib$ on the reductions and $uA$ on the auxiliary curves, compatible with $gb$, $gA$ and the structure morphisms, and intertwining the two isogenies $\varphi$ up to $r$-power multiplications.
--
--   Under all these hypotheses, two assertions hold.
--
--   First, for every prime $\ell$ with $\ell \neq r$ and $\ell$ invertible in $k$, and every extra level structure $K_0$ of level $\ell$ on $A_0$: if $K_0$ is stable under $e\gamma$, in the sense that for every scheme $T$, every morphism $t$ from $T$ to $\operatorname{Spec}(Onr/\pi)$ and every point $R$ of $A_0$ over $t$, $R$ factoring through $K_0.levK$ implies that $R$ followed by $e\gamma$ also factors through $K_0.levK$, then for all extra level structures $C$ and $C'$ of level $\ell$ on $E$ such that $C$ is transported from $K_0$ along $\varrho$ — for every $T$, every $t'$ from $T$ to $\operatorname{Spec}$ of the quotient of $k$ by the ideal generated by the image of $\pi$, and every point $R$ of $\varrho.Eb$ over $t'$, if $R$ followed by $\varrho.gb$ factors through $C.levK$ then $R$ followed by $\varrho.\varphi$ and then $\varrho.gA$ factors through $K_0.levK$ — and $C'$ is transported from $K_0$ along $\varrho''$ in the same sense, the two extra levels cut out the same points of $E$: for every scheme $T$, every $t$ from $T$ to $\operatorname{Spec} k$ and every point $R$ of $E$ over $t$, $R$ factors through $C.levK$ if and only if it factors through $C'.levK$.
--
--   Second, conversely, for every prime $\ell$ with $\ell \neq r$ and $\ell$ invertible in $k$, every extra level structure $K_0$ of level $\ell$ on $A_0$ and all extra level structures $C$, $C''$ of level $\ell$ on $E$: if $C$ is transported from $K_0$ along $\varrho$ and $C''$ is transported from $K_0$ along $\varrho''$, both in the above sense, and $C$ and $C''$ cut out the same points of $E$ over $k$, then $K_0$ is stable under $e\gamma$, that is, for every scheme $T$, every morphism $t$ from $T$ to $\operatorname{Spec}(Onr/\pi)$ and every point $R$ of $A_0$ over $t$, if $R$ factors through $K_0.levK$ then so does $R$ followed by $e\gamma$.
--
--   This is the extra-level half of the one-leg fibre analysis in the Čerednik–Drinfeld uniformisation of the fake elliptic curve tower: it transports extra level structures of order prime to $r$ through a rigidification and its $e_\gamma$-translate, and shows that equality of the transported levels on points is equivalent to $e_\gamma$-stability of the level on the special fibre. It is obtained by combining the two companion statements for the two directions, and is used in the construction of the pullback of an isomorphism of rigidified curves compatible with the level homomorphism.

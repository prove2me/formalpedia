# Projective Families of Measures

This file bundles a family of finite-dimensional measures together with their
projective consistency and probability-measure properties into a single
`ProjectiveFamily` structure. This is the natural input for the Kolmogorov
extension theorem: given a projective family, the theorem produces a measure
on the infinite product space whose finite-dimensional marginals match.

## Main definitions

* `ProbabilityTheory.ProjectiveFamily` — a structure bundling a family of
  measures indexed by `Finset ι`, consistency, and the probability property.
* `ProbabilityTheory.ProjectiveFamily.ofProcess` — constructs a projective
  family from a measurable stochastic process under a probability measure.

## Main results

* `ProbabilityTheory.ProjectiveFamily.restrict_eq` — restricting from `I` to
  `J ⊆ I` recovers `measure J`.
* `ProbabilityTheory.ProjectiveFamily.map_map_restrict` — composing two
  successive restrictions equals a single restriction.

- a family of measures on finite products, indexed by `Finset ι`;
- projective consistency (`IsProjectiveMeasureFamily`);
- the probability measure property for each index set.

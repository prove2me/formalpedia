-- title:
--   Radial angle is injective from an interior center
-- statement:
--   Let $A$ be a finite convex-independent planar set and let $c$ lie in the interior of $\operatorname{conv}(A)$. Then distinct points of $A$ determine distinct oriented radial angles about $c$. Indeed, equal directions would place one vertex on the open segment from $c$ to another vertex, contradicting extremality. This permits the vertices to be sorted by angle without ties.

# ConvexCyclicOrder Step 2 — polar-sort construction (partial)

Constructive content toward `Problem97.exists_isCcwConvexPolygon_of_convexIndep`
(Step 2 of the ConvexCyclicOrder construction lane used by the CGN bridge).

Strategy (locked in `docs/97-convex-cyclic-order-step2-spec.md`): enumerate `A`
by angular order around an interior point `c` of `convexHull A`, using the
in-tree `Problem97.arcAngle c · : ℝ² → Real.Angle` and Mathlib's
`Real.Angle.instCircularOrder`, cutting the circular order open at an anchor.

This file currently lands the independent sub-lemmas and the geometric
injectivity sub-lemma:

* `exists_center_interior_convexHull_of_convexIndep_noncoll` (spec §3.1) — an
  interior point of `convexHull A` exists, from `¬ Collinear ⇒ affineSpan = ⊤`.
* `three_le_card_of_convexIndep_noncoll` (spec §3.6) — `¬ Collinear ⇒ 3 ≤ A.card`.
* `arcAngle_injective_of_center_interior` (spec §3.2) — for an interior center
  `c`, `arcAngle c ·` is injective on a convex-independent `A`. Distinct points
  on a common ray from `c` would force the nearer one to be an interior point of
  the hull, contradicting convex independence.

Supporting lemmas proved en route to §3.2:

* `notMem_extremePoints_of_mem_interior` — an interior point of any set in `ℝ²`
  is never an extreme point (midpoint-of-a-ball argument).
* `notMem_convexHull_diff_convexHull_of_notMem` — a Carathéodory/Hahn-Banach
  "descent": `a ∉ convexHull (A \ {a}) ⇒ a ∉ convexHull (convexHull A \ {a})`.
* `mem_extremePoints_of_convexIndep` — convex-independent points are extreme
  points of the hull.
* `notMem_interior_of_convexIndep` — convex-independent points are not interior
  to the hull.

It also lands the cut-open enumeration:

* `cutKey` (spec §3.3) — the cut-open linear key on `Real.Angle`, taken as
  `-Real.Angle.toReal` (anchor at `0`, i.e. the `+x` direction). It is globally
  injective because `toReal` is, which is all the *enumeration* lemma needs. The
  key is **negated** so that increasing `cutKey ∘ arcAngle c` walks the boundary
  *clockwise* in the standard orientation: a direct integer-coordinate check
  (recorded in `cutKey`'s docstring) shows this is the chirality
  `IsCcwConvexPolygon` requires (`(∡ ·)·.sign = 1`), whereas the
  counter-clockwise walk gives sign `-1`. This makes the enumeration directly
  consumable by the §3.5 geometric heart.
* `exists_cut_sorted_enumeration_of_convexIndep` (spec §3.4) — sort `A` by the
  cut-open key into `φ : Fin A.card → ℝ²`, strictly monotone in the key. Pure
  bookkeeping over `Finset.orderEmbOfFin` of the key-image, using §3.2 for
  injectivity of the key on `A`.

The remaining sub-lemma — §3.5, the geometric heart (cyclic angular order ⇒
CCW), and the final assembly — are **not** in this file yet; see
`docs/97-convex-cyclic-order-step2-spec.md` §3.5 and the risk register.

/-! ### Supporting helper — interior points are not extreme

An interior point of any set in `ℝ²` cannot be an extreme point: it is the
midpoint of two distinct nearby points of the set (obtained from a ball inside
the interior), so it is a non-trivial convex combination, contradicting the
extreme-point definition. -/



/-! ### §3.2 — `arcAngle` injective on `A` for an interior center

If `c` is interior to `convexHull A`, two distinct convex-independent points of
`A` cannot share a ray from `c`: the nearer one would be a strictly interior
point of the hull, contradicting convex independence. We package this through a
sequence of standard convexity facts: a Hahn-Banach "descent" lemma, the
extreme-point characterization of the hull, and the interior/extreme
incompatibility above. The injectivity statement lives on `Real.Angle` (not
`.toReal`), as required by the cut-open enumeration in §3.4. -/

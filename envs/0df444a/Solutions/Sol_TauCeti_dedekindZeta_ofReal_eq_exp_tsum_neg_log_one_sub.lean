# Elementary bounds on real powers with a negative exponent

A base at least `2` raised to a negative exponent of size at least `1` is at most `1 / 2`. This
is the shape in which the local ratio of an Euler factor is bounded away from `1`, so that the
denominator `1 - y ^ (-s)` stays bounded below.

## Main results

# Regrouping ideal arithmetic functions by absolute norm

This file defines `TauCeti.normCoeff`, the ordinary arithmetic function obtained by summing an
`IdealArithmeticFunction` over each fibre of the absolute norm.  These fibres are finite by
`Ideal.finite_setOfPred_absNorm_eq`, so the coefficients are honest finite sums.  The resulting
function has value zero at `0`, as required by Mathlib's `ArithmeticFunction` carrier; that value
is available from `ArithmeticFunction.map_zero`.

The construction is bundled as a complex-linear map.  The basic API exposes the finite norm fibre
`TauCeti.normFiber` and its finiteness, records the value at one, proves compatibility with
complex conjugation, and records in `TauCeti.norm_normCoeff_eq_sum_norm_of_nonneg` that no
cancellation occurs inside a fibre when the values of `f` are nonnegative.  Regrouping is
compatible with transporting along an isomorphism of number fields: `TauCeti.normCoeff_map` says
that an isomorphism `e : K ≃+* L` leaves every norm coefficient unchanged.

Regrouping loses information as soon as a norm fibre has more than one element:
`TauCeti.exists_forall_normCoeff_nonneg_not_forall_nonneg` produces a nonzero ideal arithmetic
function, with a negative value, whose norm coefficients all vanish.  This is the rejection test
that forbids weakening the nonnegativity hypothesis of the converse regrouping theorem to
nonnegativity of the coefficients themselves.

## Roadmap role

This is the finite-norm-fibre part of Layer **1.1** of
`TauCetiRoadmap/ArithmeticDirichletSeries/README.md`.  The next layer step uses these coefficients
to regroup an absolutely convergent series over nonzero ideals into a Mathlib `LSeries`.

# Completely multiplicative ideal weights

The completely multiplicative specializations of `TauCeti.IdealArithmeticFunction`: the two
carriers on which every Euler product, Hecke character and character-family argument of this
development is stated.

A `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight K` is a monoid-with-zero homomorphism
`Ideal (𝓞 K) →*₀ ℂ` killing only finitely many height-one primes, and
`TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight K` is the subtype of those whose values have modulus `1` away from
that finite bad set. Using Mathlib's `→*₀` vocabulary is what pins the zero-ideal law
`χ ⊥ = 0`; the finiteness condition is what bounds the bad local factors of the Euler product.

Both carriers are *degree one*: the value at `𝔭 ^ n` is forced to be `χ 𝔭 ^ n`. They are
therefore deliberately too narrow for the ideal Möbius function or for coefficient systems
whose prime-power values are independent local data; those get separate carriers.

The organising notion is `Ideal.IsPrimeTo`, an ideal of a Dedekind domain being nonzero and
divisible by no prime of a given set; it is stated for a general Dedekind domain because
nothing in it is specific to a number field. The good ideals of a weight are the ideals
prime to its bad primes, and `Ideal.IsPrimeTo.induction_on` factors such an ideal into
good primes; this is the engine behind both
`TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.apply_ne_zero_iff_isGood` and
`TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight.norm_eq_one`.

## Main declarations

* `Ideal.IsPrimeTo`: an ideal is nonzero and no prime of `S` divides it, with its
  multiplicativity (`Ideal.isPrimeTo_mul_iff`) and its induction principle
  (`Ideal.IsPrimeTo.induction_on`);
* `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight`: the general completely multiplicative carrier, its
  `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.badPrimes` and its good ideals
  (`TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.IsGood`);
* `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.apply_ne_zero_iff_isGood`: a weight is nonzero exactly on
  the good ideals;
* `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.ext_heightOneSpectrum`: a weight is determined by its
  values at the height-one primes;
* `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.ofBadPrimes`, the pointwise `CommMonoid` structure (whose
  unit is the trivial weight), `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.restrict`,
  `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.conj` and
  `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.normTwist`: the constructors and operations;
* `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.IsNormTwistOnGood` and
  `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.IsTrivialOnGood`: the weights agreeing with a purely
  imaginary norm twist, respectively with the trivial weight, on their good ideals, with the
  structure theorem `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.IsNormTwistOnGood.eq_normTwist`, its
  converse `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.isNormTwistOnGood_normTwist_ofBadPrimes`, and the
  behaviour of the parameter under conjugation, the pointwise product and a further twist;
* `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.toIdealArithmeticFunction`: passage to the general
  carrier, inverted by `TauCeti.IdealArithmeticFunction.zeroExtend`;
* `TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight`: the unitary subtype, with
  `TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight.norm_eq_one` on all good ideals,
  `TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight.norm_normTwist` for the modulus of an arbitrary norm twist,
  `TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight.ofPowEqOne` for finite-order weights, and the operations
  `TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight.conj`, `TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight.restrict` and
  `TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight.normTwist` (the last for the imaginary norm twists only), and
  `TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight.toIdealArithmeticFunction` for its passage to the general carrier;
* `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.map` and `TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight.map`, with their
  equivalences `mapEquiv`: functoriality under an isomorphism `K ≃+* L` of the ambient fields,
  together with the identity and composition laws, the preservation of the pointwise product
  (`map_one` and `map_mul` on both carriers), the naturality of restriction, conjugation and norm
  twists, and the compatibilities
  `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.badPrimes_map` and
  `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.toIdealArithmeticFunction_map`.

## Rejection tests

The two worked negative examples of this layer are proved here.
`TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.coe_ne_const_one` says the everywhere-one function on *all*
integral ideals underlies no weight, because `→*₀` forces the value `0` at `⊥` — the
everywhere-one function on the *nonzero* ideals is the trivial weight instead
(`TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.toIdealArithmeticFunction_one`).
`TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight.norm_normTwist_apply_ne_one` says that a norm twist with
`Re z ≠ 0` changes the modulus at every good ideal of absolute norm greater than one, so such
twists live only in the general carrier.

# Regrouping an ideal-indexed Dirichlet series by absolute norm

An `TauCeti.IdealArithmeticFunction K` has two Dirichlet series attached to it: the series indexed
by the nonzero integral ideals of `𝓞 K`, whose terms are `TauCeti.idealTerm`, and the Mathlib
`LSeries` of the regrouped coefficients `TauCeti.normCoeff`. This file proves that the second is
obtained from the first by summing over the finite absolute-norm fibres, so that absolute
convergence of the ideal-indexed series transfers to the `LSeries` together with the value of the
sum.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.idealTerm f s I` is the term `f I / N(I) ^ s` of the ideal-indexed Dirichlet series.
* `TauCeti.idealAbscissaOfAbsConv f` is the abscissa of absolute convergence of that series, the
  ideal-indexed analogue of Mathlib's `LSeries.abscissaOfAbsConv`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.regroupByNorm`: if the ideal-indexed series has sum `L` at `s`, then so does the
  `LSeries` of `TauCeti.normCoeff f`; `TauCeti.LSeriesSummable_normCoeff` and
  `TauCeti.LSeries_normCoeff` are the summability and value statements it packages.
* `TauCeti.summable_log_absNorm_mul_norm_idealTerm_of_re_lt_re`: weighting the ideal terms
  by `log N(I)` keeps them summable strictly to the right of a point of absolute convergence.
* `TauCeti.abscissaOfAbsConv_normCoeff_le`: consequently the grouped abscissa of absolute
  convergence is at most the ideal-indexed one.
* `TauCeti.summable_idealTerm_of_norm_normCoeff_eq_sum_norm`: the converse holds whenever no
  cancellation occurs inside a norm fibre. `TauCeti.summable_idealTerm_of_nonneg` and
  `TauCeti.idealAbscissaOfAbsConv_eq_abscissaOfAbsConv` specialize it to the case where every
  *individual ideal summand* is nonnegative, where moreover the two abscissae agree.

## Implementation notes

The regrouping is an instance of Mathlib's `HasSum.tsum_fiberwise` along the absolute norm
`fun I ↦ Ideal.absNorm (I : Ideal (𝓞 K))`, whose fibres are the finite sets
`TauCeti.normFiber K n`. Absolute convergence of the ideal-indexed series is expressed as plain
`Summable`, which for a complex-valued family is unconditional convergence and hence absolute
convergence; no rearrangement hypothesis is therefore needed for the transfer.

The converse is proved through `summable_partition` applied to the norms of the terms. All it
needs about `f` is that the norm of each grouped coefficient is the sum of the norms over its
fibre — the absence of cancellation inside the fibre. Nonnegativity of every ideal summand is one
way to secure that, through `TauCeti.norm_normCoeff_eq_sum_norm_of_nonneg`; it is the step that
fails under cancellation, as the rejection test
`TauCeti.exists_forall_normCoeff_nonneg_not_forall_nonneg` records. That test is a statement about
`TauCeti.normCoeff` alone, so it lives with that definition rather than here.

## Roadmap role

This is Layer **1.2** of `TauCetiRoadmap/ArithmeticDirichletSeries/README.md`; the required worked
example 9 accompanies it in `TauCeti/NumberTheory/ArithmeticDirichletSeries/NormCoeff.lean`. The
exact value of the abscissa for the trivial weight is deliberately not proved here: its divergence
input is the Layer 5 ideal count of
`TauCeti/NumberTheory/ArithmeticDirichletSeries/Estimates.lean`.

# The trivial ideal weight and Dedekind zeta coefficients

This file identifies the norm coefficients of the trivial ideal weight with the coefficients of
the Dedekind zeta function.  There is one necessary exception: Mathlib's coefficient counts all
integral ideals and therefore has value `1` at index zero, contributed by the zero ideal, whereas
an `ArithmeticFunction` has value zero there.  Since `LSeries` ignores its zero coefficient, the
two coefficient systems define the same series.

For the rational field the ring of integers is isomorphic to `ℤ`.  Mapping an ideal through this
isomorphism and using `Int.ideal_span_absNorm_eq_self` shows that there is exactly one ideal of
each positive norm.  Thus the trivial ideal weight over `ℚ` regroups to the constant coefficient
`1` at every positive index, as for the Riemann zeta function.

## Roadmap role

This is Layer **1.3**, the trivial specialization, of
`TauCetiRoadmap/ArithmeticDirichletSeries/README.md`.  It completes Layer 1 without asserting the
exact abscissa of convergence; that is Layer 5, proved in
`TauCeti.abscissaOfAbsConv_normCoeff_one`.

# Linear ideal counts and the exact abscissa of the trivial ideal weight

Mathlib's `NumberField.Ideal.tendsto_norm_le_div_atTop₀` says that the number of nonzero integral
ideals of `𝓞 K` of absolute norm at most `x` is asymptotic to `ρ x`, with `ρ` the positive residue
of the Dedekind zeta function.  This file turns that single asymptotic into the *two-sided* linear
bounds that every later estimate of the roadmap counts against, and then spends them on the exact
abscissa of absolute convergence of the trivial ideal weight.

Both directions are needed.  Convergence uses the upper bound alone: it makes the partial sums of
the norm coefficients `O(n)`, so Mathlib's `LSeriesSummable_of_sum_norm_bigO` gives absolute
convergence on `Re s > 1`.  Divergence at `s = 1` uses both bounds together, to estimate the mass
of a block `N < n ≤ m N` of fixed ratio `m` as a difference of endpoint counts: the lower bound at
the right endpoint `m N` and the upper bound at the left endpoint `N` leave the block at least
`lower * m N - upper * N` of coefficient mass, so the terms `‖a n‖ / n` add up to at least
`lower - upper / m`, which is at least `lower / 2` once `m ≥ 2 * upper / lower`, while the blocks
of a convergent series of nonnegative terms must become arbitrarily small.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IdealCountingLinearBounds K` packages positive constants `lower` and `upper` with the
  two-sided bound `lower * x ≤ #{I ≠ 0 | N(I) ≤ x} ≤ upper * x`, valid from cutoff `1` on.
* `TauCeti.card_primePowersLE_isBigO` transfers the upper ideal-count bound to the number of
  prime-power ideals at most `x`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.idealCount_linearBounds`: such a package exists for every number field.
* `TauCeti.abscissaOfAbsConv_normCoeff_one`: the abscissa of absolute convergence of the trivial
  ideal weight is exactly `1`; `TauCeti.LSeriesSummable_normCoeff_one_iff` is the sharp
  convergence criterion.
* `TauCeti.abscissaOfAbsConv_dedekindZetaCoeff` and `TauCeti.LSeriesSummable_dedekindZetaCoeff_iff`
  are the same two statements for `TauCeti.dedekindZetaCoeff`, the coefficient system Mathlib's
  `NumberField.dedekindZeta` is the `LSeries` of.  That system counts *all* integral ideals, so it
  differs from the trivial norm coefficients at `n = 0` and the two statements are related only
  through the `n ≠ 0` congruence `LSeries.abscissaOfAbsConv_congr`.
* `TauCeti.summable_idealTerm_of_bounded_of_one_lt_re`: a uniformly bounded weight has an
  absolutely convergent ideal-indexed Dirichlet series on `Re s > 1`, and
  `TauCeti.summable_idealTerm_of_unitary_of_one_lt_re` is its unitary specialization.
* `TauCeti.idealAbscissaOfAbsConv_lt_re_of_bounded`: the same hypothesis places the ideal-indexed
  abscissa of absolute convergence strictly below every `Re s > 1`.

## Implementation notes

The counting function is Mathlib's own
`Nat.card {I : (Ideal (𝓞 K))⁰ // (Ideal.absNorm (I : Ideal (𝓞 K)) : ℝ) ≤ x}`, written out rather
than abbreviated, so that the bounds apply to `NumberField.Ideal.tendsto_norm_le_div_atTop₀`
without a translation lemma.  The inclusive real cutoff is the one fixed by the conventions table
of the roadmap.

`TauCeti.NumberTheory.EffectiveBounds.IdealCount` proves the *effective* bound
`#{I ≠ 0 | N(I) ≤ x} ≤ x² 2^[K:ℚ]`, with an explicit constant but the wrong exponent; it cannot
prove convergence at `Re s > 1`, and it has no lower bound at all.

## Relationship to other estimates

The unweighted prime-power cardinality estimate is separate from the weighted higher-prime-power
estimates in `HigherPrimePowers.lean`.  The abscissa results above depend only on the two-sided
linear ideal counts, not on the analytic continuation of the Dedekind zeta function or its pole at
`s = 1`.

# Canonical local factors and formal Euler products for ideal arithmetic functions

This file develops the Euler-product layer for arithmetic functions on nonzero ideals. It builds
the canonical formal power series at each height-one prime and sends that series into Mathlib's
`ArithmeticFunction.ofPowerSeries` API. The resulting local arithmetic factor has the prescribed
prime-power values and vanishes away from powers of the prime-ideal norm.

It then restricts an ideal arithmetic function to the nonzero ideals whose prime factors lie in a
prescribed set of height-one primes, and proves that for a *finite* set of primes the norm
coefficients of that restriction are exactly the product of the local factors, taken in Mathlib's
Dirichlet convolution of arithmetic functions. Passing to Mathlib's formal Euler product gives the
norm coefficients of the original function. Everything here is a formal identity of coefficients:
no analytic convergence hypothesis enters.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IdealArithmeticFunction.localPowerSeries` has coefficient `f (P ^ n)` at `n`.
* `TauCeti.IdealArithmeticFunction.localArithmeticFactor` realizes that power series as an
  arithmetic function supported on powers of `N(P)`.
* `TauCeti.IdealArithmeticFunction.supportedPart f S` is `f` restricted to the nonzero ideals all
  of whose prime factors lie in `S`, and zero elsewhere.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IdealArithmeticFunction.supportedPart_insert`: for a multiplicative `f`, adjoining one
  prime to the support convolves the restriction with the restriction to the powers of that prime.
* `TauCeti.IdealArithmeticFunction.normCoeff_supportedPart`: the **finite Euler product**
  `normCoeff (supportedPart f S) = ∏ P ∈ S, localArithmeticFactor f P` for a multiplicative `f`
  and a finite set `S` of height-one primes.
* `TauCeti.IdealArithmeticFunction.normCoeff_eq_eulerProduct`: the norm coefficients of a
  multiplicative ideal arithmetic function are Mathlib's formal Euler product of its canonical
  local factors.

## Implementation notes

"Supported on `S`" is spelled `Ideal.IsPrimeTo · Sᶜ`: no prime *outside* `S` divides the ideal.
That predicate, and the splitting `Ideal.IsPrimeTo.exists_eq_pow_mul` of an ideal into a prime
power times a cofactor together with its uniqueness `Ideal.eq_and_eq_of_pow_mul_eq_pow_mul`, live
in `TauCeti/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/Ideal.lean`, since nothing in them is specific to a number
field. Uniqueness is what makes the induction work: it is why exactly one summand of the ideal
convolution survives at each ideal. The multiplicativity of `f` over a prime-power factorization,
`TauCeti.IdealArithmeticFunction.IsMultiplicative.map_prod_pow`, likewise lives with the predicate
it elaborates, in `TauCeti/NumberTheory/ArithmeticDirichletSeries/Basic.lean`.

`TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.restrict` is the opposite regime and is not a substitute:
it restricts *away from* a **finite** set of primes and stays inside the bundled weight carrier. A
finite Euler product needs support on a *finite* set of primes, so all but finitely many primes are
bad; such a function is never a `MultiplicativeIdealWeight`, whose zero support is finite by
definition. Hence `supportedPart` is a plain ideal arithmetic function.

Finiteness is what carries the finite products to the full Euler product. A nonzero ideal has
only finitely many prime divisors, and only finitely many primes have norm at most a given `n`, so
at a fixed norm coefficient the restriction `supportedPart f S` already agrees with `f` as soon as
`S` contains those primes. Each finite product is therefore eventually the exact norm coefficient,
and Mathlib's `ArithmeticFunction.eulerProduct`, being the limit of those finite products, computes
the norm coefficients of `f` itself. The local factors are derived from `f` rather than stored, so
this identity holds for any multiplicative `f` with no further data.

# Euler-product coefficient data over a number field

This file bundles the algebraic input for an Euler product over the height-one primes of the ring
of integers of a number field. An `EulerProductData K` consists of an ideal arithmetic function
that is multiplicative on relatively prime nonzero ideals. The prime-power series and local
arithmetic factors are canonically derived from the function as defined in
`EulerProduct/Basic.lean`, so nothing about the local behaviour is stored: the bundle carries
exactly the one algebraic hypothesis that an Euler product consumes.

The formal Euler-product identity follows from
`IdealArithmeticFunction.normCoeff_eq_eulerProduct`: coprime multiplicativity and unique
factorization prove that `normCoeff` is Mathlib's `ArithmeticFunction.eulerProduct` of the
canonical local factors.

Two hypotheses of the classical theory are deliberately absent, because the identity proved here
does not need either. There is no distinguished finite set of exceptional primes: multiplicativity
is required on every coprime pair of nonzero ideals, and the local factor at a prime is read off
from the coefficients at its powers, good or bad. There is also no analytic input: the identity is
an equality of arithmetic functions, and the convergence of the evaluated factors to an infinite
product is a separate question.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.EulerProductData` bundles a multiplicative ideal coefficient system.
* `TauCeti.EulerProductData.ofMultiplicativeIdealWeight` regards a degree-one ideal weight as
  Euler-product data.
* Pointwise multiplication, complex conjugation, and restriction away from sets of primes
  preserve the bundle.

# The analytic Euler product of an ideal arithmetic function

`TauCeti.EulerProductData.normCoeff_eq_eulerProduct` identifies the norm coefficients of bundled
Euler-product data with a formal Euler product, coefficient by coefficient. This file supplies the
analytic statement it does not: where the Dirichlet series indexed by the nonzero ideals converges
absolutely, the infinite product of the local Euler factors converges, in the unrestricted sense
of `HasProd` over the height-one primes, to the `LSeries` of the norm coefficients.

The local factor at a height-one prime `P` is the `LSeries` of the canonical local arithmetic
factor, equivalently the prime-power Dirichlet series `∑' e, f (P ^ e) / N(P ^ e) ^ s`. For a
completely multiplicative weight that series is geometric, and the factor takes the familiar
closed form `(1 - χ(P) N(P) ^ (-s))⁻¹`; specializing to the trivial weight gives the Euler
product of the Dedekind zeta function.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.EulerProductData.eulerFactor`: the local Euler factor at a height-one prime.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.EulerProductData.hasProd_eulerFactor`: the **analytic Euler product**, when the
  ideal-indexed Dirichlet series converges absolutely at `s`.
* `TauCeti.EulerProductData.norm_absNorm_cpow_neg_le_radius_localPowerSeries`: a lower bound for
  the convergence radius of a local power series from absolute convergence at a real point.
* `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.hasProd_eulerFactor`: the same product, with the local factors
  in the closed geometric form available for a completely multiplicative weight.
* `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.LSeries_ne_zero_of_summable_idealTerm`: the `L`-series is
  **nonzero** wherever the ideal-indexed series converges absolutely.
* `TauCeti.dedekindZeta_eulerProduct_hasProd`: the **Euler product of the Dedekind zeta
  function**, valid on `Re s > 1`.
* `TauCeti.dedekindZeta_ne_zero_of_one_lt_re`: the Dedekind zeta function is **nonzero** on
  `Re s > 1`.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.one_lt_norm_absNorm_cpow` and
  `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.absNorm_cpow_sub_one_ne_zero`: analytic bounds for the
  complex powers of prime-ideal norms on the right half-plane.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.logDeriv_one_sub_absNorm_cpow_neg`: the logarithmic
  derivative of a deleted Euler factor.

The nonvanishing is pointwise, at each `s` where the ideal-indexed series converges absolutely, and
nothing is claimed off that region. It is not a formality: an unconditionally convergent product of
nonzero factors may still vanish.

# The Euler product over the primes of a number field, in exponential form

Mathlib's `EulerProduct.exp_tsum_primes_log_eq_tsum` writes the Euler product of a completely
multiplicative `f : ℕ →*₀ ℂ` as `exp (∑' p, -log (1 - f p))`. This file is the ideal-indexed
analogue, over the height-one primes of the ring of integers of a number field, mirroring the way
`TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.hasProd_eulerFactor` mirrors Mathlib's product form.

The logarithm is taken factor by factor, using the principal value: absolute convergence of the
ideal-indexed series forces each local ratio into the open unit disc, where `Complex.log (1 - ·)`
is defined without choosing anything.

**What this does not give.** `exp` is not injective, so an identity of the form `exp t = L`
determines `t` only modulo `2πi ℤ`; these theorems therefore do not exhibit a logarithm *of* the
`L`-series, and in particular are not a holomorphic branch on a region.
`TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.LSeries_ne_zero_of_summable_idealTerm` supplies nonvanishing
pointwise, wherever the ideal-indexed series converges absolutely; a branch needs more than that —
a simply connected zero-free region on which to choose one — and is not constructed here.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.summable_neg_log_one_sub`: summability of the
  prime-indexed logarithm sum wherever the ideal-indexed series converges absolutely.
* `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.exp_tsum_neg_log_one_sub_eq_LSeries`: the `L`-series as the
  exponential of a sum of principal logarithms over the primes.
* `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.tsum_prime_pow_eq_tsum_neg_log_one_sub`: that sum re-indexed
  by a prime and an exponent, as an identity of complex numbers.
* `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.exp_tsum_prime_pow_eq_LSeries`: the exponential form of the
  re-indexed sum.

# The real Euler product of the Dedekind zeta function in exponential form

For real `s > 1`, every local ratio `x = N(𝔭) ^ (-s)` of a height-one prime lies in `(0, 1/2]`,
because `N(𝔭) ≥ 2`. The principal logarithm of each Euler factor is then the real number
`-log (1 - x)`, and the exponential form
`TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.exp_tsum_neg_log_one_sub_eq_LSeries` of the Euler product,
specialized to the trivial weight, becomes a statement about real numbers: `ζ_K(s)` is the
exponential of the convergent real sum `∑_𝔭 -log (1 - N(𝔭) ^ (-s))`. In particular `ζ_K(s)` is a
positive real number, and that sum is its real logarithm.

## Main results

* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.absNorm_rpow_neg_le_half`: `N(𝔭) ^ (-s) ≤ 1/2`
  for `1 ≤ s`.
* `TauCeti.summable_neg_log_one_sub_absNorm_rpow`: `∑_𝔭 -log (1 - N(𝔭) ^ (-s))` converges for
  `1 < s`.
* `TauCeti.dedekindZeta_ofReal_eq_exp_tsum_neg_log_one_sub`: for real `s > 1`, `ζ_K(s)` is the
  exponential of that real sum.
* `TauCeti.dedekindZeta_re_eq_exp` and `TauCeti.dedekindZeta_re_pos`: the same for the real part,
  which is therefore positive.
* `TauCeti.log_dedekindZeta_re_eq_tsum_neg_log_one_sub`: that real sum is the real logarithm of
  `ζ_K(s)`.

## References

* The real logarithmic identity also appears, under the same name, in the
  Birkbeck–Brasca Chebotarev density project, <https://github.com/CBirkbeck/chebotarev-density>
  (Apache-2.0), commit `8575c9df1ae0a61120ab5c964c7911414254bec7`, file
  `CebotarevDensity/Density.lean`, where it is proved from `Real.hasProd_of_hasSum_log` and the
  product formula. It is derived here instead from TauCeti's exponential Euler product
  `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.exp_tsum_neg_log_one_sub_eq_LSeries`.

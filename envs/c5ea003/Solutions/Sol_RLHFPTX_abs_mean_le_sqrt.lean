# The PTX pretraining mix-in creates a `β`-independent alignment floor

Domain: Novelty (information theory × convex analysis × alignment theory).

## The question

Earlier cycles of this thread studied the KL-regularised RLHF optimum
`π_β = argmax_q  𝔼_q[r] − β · KL(q ‖ p)`, whose closed form is the Gibbs tilt
`π_β(y) ∝ p(y) e^{r(y)/β}`, and established the *drift law*
`‖π_β − p‖₁ = Θ(σ_p(r)/β)`: as the KL penalty `β → ∞` the aligned policy returns
to the reference policy `p` at rate `1/β`, with constant the reward standard
deviation.

Production RLHF (InstructGPT-style) adds a **PTX pretraining mix-in**: a fraction
`γ` of pretraining data, drawn from a distribution `d`, is folded back into the
objective.  In the *anchor* formulation adopted here the mix-in replaces the
reference measure by the mixture `p_γ = (1−γ)p + γd`, so the optimum becomes

  `q*_{β,γ}(y) ∝ ((1−γ) p(y) + γ d(y)) · e^{r(y)/β}`.

This file proves the resulting **two-scale drift law**: the total drift away from
the SFT policy `p` splits into a `β`-independent term coming from the mix-in and a
reward-induced term obeying the old `σ/β` law.

## Main results

* `RLHFPTX.l1_mix_self` — `‖p_γ − p‖₁ = γ · ‖d − p‖₁`, exactly.
* `RLHFPTX.gibbs_l1_le_sd` — the reward-induced drift from the *anchor*:
  `‖gibbs β m r − m‖₁ ≤ e^{(M−L)/β} · σ_m(r) / β` for any `L ≤ r ≤ M`.
  (This is the cycle-2 `σ/β` law, reproved here self-containedly.)
* `RLHFPTX.ptx_drift_upper` / `RLHFPTX.ptx_drift_lower` — the two-sided estimate
  `|‖q*_{β,γ} − p‖₁ − γ‖d − p‖₁| ≤ e^{(M−L)/β} σ_{p_γ}(r)/β`.
* `RLHFPTX.ptx_l1_tendsto` — hence `‖q*_{β,γ} − p‖₁ → γ‖d − p‖₁` as `β → ∞`.
* `RLHFPTX.ptx_no_return_to_p` — **the alignment floor**: if `γ > 0` and `d ≠ p`
  then `‖q*_{β,γ} − p‖₁` does *not* tend to `0`; no amount of KL regularisation
  brings the PTX-augmented optimum back to the SFT policy.
* `RLHFPTX.gibbs_beta_l1_tendsto_mad` — the *sharp* constant of the reward-induced
  part: `β · ‖gibbs β m r − m‖₁ → 𝔼_m|r − 𝔼_m r|`, the **mean absolute deviation**,
  not the standard deviation.
* `RLHFPTX.mad_le_sd` and `RLHFPTX.sq_sd_le_range_mul_mad` — the guard that turns
  the sharp constant back into a `Θ(σ/β)` statement:
  `σ²/(M−L) ≤ MAD ≤ σ`.  So the `σ/β` law is two-sided exactly up to the
  dimensionless factor `σ/(M−L)`, and *not* better: the honest first-order
  constant is the MAD.
* `RLHFPTX.ptx_beta_l1_tendsto_mad` — the reward-induced part of the PTX drift,
  measured from the mixture anchor, obeys the same sharp law.
* `RLHFPTX.ptxOpt_optimal` — a Gibbs variational principle showing that `q*_{β,γ}` really
  is the maximiser of the PTX objective `q ↦ 𝔼_q[r] − β KL(q ‖ p_γ)`, so all of the above
  are statements about a genuine optimisation problem, not about an ad hoc formula.
* `RLHFPTX.anchor_return_iff` — model independence: for *any* anchor `m`,
  `‖gibbs β m r − p‖₁ → 0` iff `m = p`; instantiated at the *geometric* mix-in
  `p^{1−γ}d^γ/Z` in `RLHFPTX.geoMix_return_iff`, so the floor is not an artefact of the
  arithmetic mixture model.
* `RLHFPTX.ptx_mean_tendsto` — the tax in reward units: the achieved reward converges to
  `𝔼_p[r] + γ(𝔼_d[r] − 𝔼_p[r])`, a `β`-independent shift.
* `RLHFPTX.ptx_beta_l1_expansion` — the exact `1/β` coefficient of the *total* drift, a
  **signed** covariance `∑_y sgn(p_γ y − p y) p_γ y (r y − 𝔼_{p_γ} r)`; unlike the drift from
  the anchor it can be negative, so reward optimisation may partially cancel the tax.

## Relation to the earlier cycles

The cycle-2 modules that established the `σ/β` law are not part of this snapshot of the
catalog (the files present reference modules that are absent), so this file is written to be
self-contained: it reproves the `σ/β` law it needs, in the same formulation, before
extending it.

## Method

No differentiation of the free energy anywhere.  The reward-induced bound comes
from the elementary convexity estimate `|e^a − e^b| ≤ e^{max a b}|a − b|`
(`RLHFPTX.abs_exp_sub_exp_le`) combined with the variational characterisation
`Var(X) ≤ 𝔼(X − c)²`, and the sharp constant comes from the derivative of
`t ↦ e^{ct}` at `t = 0` transported along `β ↦ 1/β`.

/-! ## 8. `q*_{β,γ}` really is the PTX optimum: a Gibbs variational principle

The results above are statements about the *formula* `q*_{β,γ} ∝ p_γ e^{r/β}`.  This section
closes the loop by proving that this formula is exactly the maximiser of the PTX-augmented
RLHF objective `q ↦ 𝔼_q[r] − β KL(q ‖ p_γ)`, so the drift laws above are statements about a
genuine optimum. -/









/-! ## 9. The alignment floor is a property of the anchor, not of the mixture model

The arithmetic mixture `p_γ = (1−γ)p + γd` is one way to model the PTX mix-in.  This section
shows the floor phenomenon is *model independent*: for **any** anchor `m`, the `β → ∞` limit
of `‖gibbs β m r − p‖₁` is exactly `‖m − p‖₁`, so the optimum returns to `p` iff the anchor
*is* `p`.  We then instantiate this at the *geometric* mix-in `p^{1−γ}d^γ / Z`, the anchor
produced by adding a `KL(q ‖ d)` term rather than mixing the data. -/










/-! ## 10. The floor in reward units: a `β`-independent alignment tax

The drift floor is a statement in total variation.  Dualising against the reward itself turns
it into a statement about the *achieved reward*: the mix-in shifts it by the `β`-independent
amount `γ(𝔼_d r − 𝔼_p r)`, which is negative exactly when the pretraining distribution is
worse-rewarded than the SFT policy. -/





/-! ## 11. The exact `1/β` correction to the floor: a signed covariance

Sections 6–7 give `‖q*_{β,γ} − p‖₁ = γ‖d − p‖₁ + O(1/β)` and identify the sharp constant
of the drift *from the anchor*.  Here we identify the exact `1/β` coefficient of the drift
*from `p`* under the nondegeneracy condition that the anchor differs from `p` in every
coordinate.  The coefficient is a **signed** covariance, so — unlike the drift from the
anchor, which is a positive multiple of `MAD` — reward optimisation can *reduce* the total
drift, partially cancelling the pretraining tax. -/

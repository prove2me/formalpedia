-- statement:
--   **Reversal invariance.**  A magma and its opposite have the same associativity defect:
--   `(a,b,c) ↦ (c,b,a)` is a bijection between their defect sets.

# The associativity defect of a finite unital magma

This file is the combinatorial counterpart of `Catalog/Combinatorics/CodiscreteMagmaBicategory.lean`.
There we showed that *every* pointed magma `M` produces a coherent bicategory `MagmaBicat M`
whose weak associator repairs the associativity defect of `M`.  Here we measure that defect.

For a finite pointed magma we set
`defect M = #{(a,b,c) : (a*b)*c ≠ a*(b*c)}`.

Main results:
* `UnitalMagmaDefect.defect_eq_zero_iff` : `defect M = 0` iff `M` is associative;
* `UnitalMagmaDefect.assocCount_prod` : the number of *associative* triples is multiplicative
  under products of magmas, i.e. the associativity density is multiplicative;
* `UnitalMagmaDefect.defect_congr` and `UnitalMagmaDefect.defect_op` : the defect is invariant
  under magma isomorphism and under passing to the opposite magma;
* `UnitalMagmaDefect.defect_even_of_comm` : the defect of a finite **commutative** magma is
  always even (reversal involution, palindromic triples are never defective), whence
  `defect_ne_one_of_comm`;
* `UnitalMagmaDefect.defect_le_of_comm_unital` and
  `UnitalMagmaDefect.exists_comm_unital_magma_maximal_defect` : the sharp commutative bound
  `(n-1)^3 - (n-1)^2`, attained by the *negation magma* `NegMagma (ZMod m)` for odd `m`;
* `UnitalMagmaDefect.card_nonidentity_associators` and `strict_iff_defect_zero` : the bridge to
  the bicategory, `defect M` counts the non-identity associator instances of `MagmaBicat M`;
* `UnitalMagmaDefect.defect_le_of_unital` : if `1` is a two-sided unit then no defect triple can
  involve `1`, whence `defect M ≤ (card M - 1) ^ 3`;
* `UnitalMagmaDefect.ShiftMagma.defect_eq` : the *shift magma* `ShiftMagma σ = Option S`
  attached to a fixed-point-free self-map `σ : S → S` is a unital magma **every** one of whose
  non-unit triples is defective, so it attains the bound;
* `UnitalMagmaDefect.exists_unital_magma_maximal_defect` : for every `n ≥ 3` there is a unital
  magma of cardinality `n` with `defect = (n-1)^3`, i.e. the bound above is sharp;
* `UnitalMagmaDefect.AdjoinOne.defect_eq` : freely adjoining a unit to a magma changes no
  associativity defect, so every defect profile occurs for a *unital* magma;
* `UnitalMagmaDefect.shiftMagma_not_strict` / `shiftMagma_coherent` : the corresponding
  codiscrete bicategory is genuinely weak (not strict), yet all of its 2-cells are invertible
  and any two parallel 2-cells agree.

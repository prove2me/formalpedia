--   `r ≠ 1` the symmetrized adjacent divergences are *constant* `(1-r)²/r`, hence never

# Sharp two-sided summand asymptotics and quantitative tails for `γ`

This file continues the research thread on the Euler–Mascheroni constant that was
started in `Novelty/EulerMascheroniInformationBridge.lean`, where `γ` was realised
as the accumulated Kullback–Leibler divergence

  `γ = ∑ k, D(Exp(k+1) ‖ Exp(k+2))`,   `gammaTerm k = 1/(k+1) - log((k+2)/(k+1))`.

We prove here the four "future directions" that were left open there.

## Main results

* `gammaTerm_lower_bound` / `gammaTerm_upper_bound` — the *purely rational squeeze*
  `1/(2(k+2)^2) ≤ gammaTerm k ≤ 1/(2(k+1)^2)`, together with the sharper
  `gammaTerm_ge_tele : 1/(2(k+1)(k+2)) ≤ gammaTerm k`.
* `remainder_pos` and `remainder_le_inv_two_mul` — for `1 ≤ n`,
  `0 < γ - eulerMascheroniSeq n ≤ 1/(2n)`.
* `accelerated`, `abs_accelerated_error_le` — the midpoint-corrected sequence
  `accelerated n = eulerMascheroniSeq n + 1/(2(n+1))` satisfies the *explicit*
  `O(n⁻²)` bound `|γ - accelerated n| ≤ 1/(12(n+1)^2)` for **every** `n : ℕ`
  (no threshold is needed), and in fact `accelerated n ≤ γ`.
* `symKL_eq_sq_div` — the symmetrized divergence identity `D(a‖b)+D(b‖a) = (a-b)²/(ab)`,
  `summable_symKL_iff_of_ratio_bounds` — an exact summability criterion for chains of
  positive rates with bounded ratios, and its two test cases
  `hasSum_symKL_linear_rates` (polynomial rates: convergent, with sum exactly `1`)
  and `not_summable_symKL_geometric_rates` (geometric rates: always divergent).

## Method

Everything rests on two calculus lemmas for the *logarithmic ratio*
`Λ z = log(1+z) - log(1-z)` on `[0,1)`:

  `2z + 2z³/3 ≤ Λ z ≤ 2z/(1-z²)`,

each proved by exhibiting the derivative of the difference as an explicitly
nonnegative rational function (`4z⁴/(1-z²)` resp. `4z²/(1-z²)²`).  Substituting
`z = 1/(2m+1)` turns these into the two-sided rational estimate

  `2/(2m+1) + 2/(3(2m+1)³) ≤ log((m+1)/m) ≤ (2m+1)/(2m(m+1))`,

which is exactly what is needed to sandwich `gammaTerm` between two *telescoping*
sequences.  The upper telescoping sequence is the midpoint-corrected
`F m = 1/(2m) + 1/(12m²)`; the constant `1/12` is the classical Euler–Maclaurin
coefficient and the resulting bound is asymptotically sharp.

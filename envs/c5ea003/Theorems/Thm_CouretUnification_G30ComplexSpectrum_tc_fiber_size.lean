-- title:
--   The distinguished triple has a five-member spectral fibre
-- statement:
--   Let $V=\{0,\ldots,7\}$, whose ordered unit labels are $(1,7,11,13,17,19,23,29)$. Their fixed $C_2\times C_4$ coordinates are $((0,0),(0,1),(1,2),(0,3),(1,3),(0,2),(1,1),(1,0))$. The list $\mathcal T$ enumerates increasing triples of distinct indices from $V$. For $(m,n)\in\{0,1\}\times\{0,1,2,3\}$ and coordinate $(a,b)$, use $\chi_{m,n}=(-1)^{ma}i^{nb}$ and $\lambda_{m,n}(T)=\sum_{x\in T}\chi_{m,n}(x)$, represented exactly as an integer pair in $\mathbb Z[i]$. Let $T_C=[0,2,7]$, carrying unit labels $\{1,11,29\}$. Filter $\mathcal T$ by equality with its 49-bin Gaussian spectral histogram, obtaining the ordered list $F_C$. Then $$|F_C|=5.$$ This counts only the finite enumerated spectral fibre.

Gate B candidate formalization for the 56 three-subsets of U(30).

Scope:
* exact finite complex Fourier spectra over Gaussian integers;
* ten spectral classes, certified by ten explicit representatives;
* power-profile classes 32/24;
* exact complex spectral fiber of T_C = {1,11,29}, of size 5;
* explicit graph-isomorphism certificates for the five members of that fiber.

Status on 2026-10-07:
P-SCAFFOLD. This file was generated after an independent exact Python replay, but
was NOT compiled in the present execution environment because no Lean binary is
installed there. Promotion to D-Lean requires a pinned Lean/Mathlib build and an
archived build log + SHA-256 manifest.

No RH, Hilbert-Polya, prime-distribution, or asymptotic claim is made here.

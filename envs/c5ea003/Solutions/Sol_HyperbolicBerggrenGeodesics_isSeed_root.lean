# Hyperbolic–Pythagorean Geodesics: the Berggren tree in the Poincaré half-plane

This file develops a rigorous bridge between three a-priori unrelated objects:

* the **Berggren ternary tree** of primitive Pythagorean triples (combinatorics /
  arithmetic),
* the **hyperbolic plane** in the Poincaré upper half-plane model `ℍ`
  (Riemannian geometry), and
* **integer factorization** via Euler's two-representation method (number theory).

## Main results

* `bStepL_triple`, `bStepM_triple`, `bStepR_triple` : the three Berggren matrices
  `B₁, B₂, B₃` acting on Pythagorean triples are conjugate, through the Euclid
  parametrisation `(m,n) ↦ (m²-n², 2mn, m²+n²)`, to the three linear maps
  `(m,n) ↦ (2m-n, m), (2m+n, m), (m+2n, n)` on Euclid seeds.
* `seed_step*_isSeed` : the three seed maps preserve the "primitive seed" conditions
  (`0 < n < m`, `gcd m n = 1`, opposite parity).
* `cosh_dist_hpoint_I` : the exact hyperbolic cosine of the distance from the base
  point `i` to the node point `z(m,n) = (n + i)/m`, namely `(m² + n² + 1)/(2m)`.
* `hyperbolic_dist_eq_half_log_hypotenuse` : **the logarithmic trajectory theorem.**
  For every Euclid seed with hypotenuse `c = m² + n²`,
  `|d_ℍ(i, z(m,n)) - ½ log c| ≤ log 2`.
  So *every* node of the Berggren tree, no matter how deep, sits at hyperbolic
  distance `½ log c + O(1)` from the root: the geodesic trajectory is
  logarithmic — sub-linear — in the size of the triple.
* `combDepth_hypotenuse` and `no_logarithmic_depth_bound` : by contrast the
  *combinatorial* depth is **not** logarithmic. The spine `(2,1) → (3,2) → (4,3) → …`
  has depth `k` and hypotenuse only `2k² + 6k + 5`, so depth is `Θ(√c)` there.
  Hence the hyperbolic metric compresses the tree exponentially.
* `hyperbolic_ball_volume_growth` : a **no-free-lunch** theorem. The number of
  Berggren nodes inside the hyperbolic ball of radius `R` around `i` grows like
  `e^{R}`, i.e. like the hypotenuse itself. A short geodesic does not make the
  search cheap.
* `geodesic_energy_lower_bound` : the Cauchy–Schwarz bound `E ≥ d²/k` relating the
  discrete energy of a `k`-step trajectory to the hyperbolic displacement, and
  `berggren_path_energy_lower_bound`, its specialisation to Berggren paths.
* `euler_two_representations_factor` : two essentially distinct representations
  `N = a² + b² = c² + d²` produce a **non-trivial divisor** `gcd(N, ac+bd)` of `N`.
* `berggren_collision_factors` : two distinct Berggren nodes sharing a hypotenuse
  `N` factor `N`.

## Design notes

Distances are Mathlib's genuine hyperbolic metric on `UpperHalfPlane` (`ℍ`), not a
hand-rolled surrogate; `UpperHalfPlane.cosh_dist'` is the only geometric input.

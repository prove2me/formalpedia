# The diagonal part `MH_{2,2}` of the magnitude homology of tope graphs

This file continues `Geometry/MagnitudeTopeGraphs.lean`, where the magnitude chain
generators `Gen1`, `Gen2`, the differential `δ₂`, the tope graph of the coordinate
arrangement in `ℝⁿ` and its Cayley-graph model were introduced, and where the group of
`(2,2)`-cycles was identified up to a splitting.  Here we finish that computation:

7. **Degree-3 chains.** `Gen3 G ℓ` is empty for `ℓ < 3`; consequently *any* differential
   `δ₃` into the `(2,2)`-cycles is zero, and therefore
   `MH_{2,2}(G) = ker δ₂` (`MH22_equiv_cycles`).

8. **The rank of the cycles.** For a connected graph with finitely many chains,
   `rk (ker δ₂) + #Gen1 = #Gen2` in every length `ℓ ≥ 2`
   (`finrank_ker_delta2_add`), because `δ₂` is surjective onto a free module.

9. **The bidegree `(2,2)` magnitude homology of the tope graph.** Combining 8 with the
   counts `#Gen1 = 2ⁿ·C(n,2)` and `#Gen2 = 2ⁿ·n²` and the identity
   `C(n,2) + C(n+1,2) = n²`, we get
   `MH_{2,2}(topeGraph n) ≅ ℤ^{2ⁿ·C(n+1,2)}`,
   i.e. the rank is `2ⁿ` times `C(n+1,2)`, the value at degree `2` of the Hilbert
   function of the polynomial ring in `n` variables — the Stanley–Reisner ring of the
   simplex attached to each tope of the Boolean arrangement.

10. **Transport to the Coxeter Cayley graph.** Magnitude chains in degree 2 and the
    differential `δ₂` are natural under graph isomorphisms, so the same computation holds
    for the Cayley graph of the Coxeter group `(ℤ/2)ⁿ`.

Everything is self-contained: only `Mathlib` and the companion file are imported.

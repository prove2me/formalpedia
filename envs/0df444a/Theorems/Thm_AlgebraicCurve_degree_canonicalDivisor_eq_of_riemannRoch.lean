-- title:
--   Degree of a canonical divisor is 2g-2
-- statement:
--   Let $K$ and $F$ be fields with $F$ a $K$-algebra, and assume `IsCurveOver K F`: every nonzero $f \in F$ has a divisor whose coefficient at each place $v$ is $v.\mathrm{ord}\,f$ and whose degree is $0$, every place has residue field finite over $K$, and the module of Kähler differentials $\Omega[F⁄K]$ is free of rank one over $F$. Assume further `HasCanonicalDivisor`, i.e. every nonzero $\omega \in \Omega[F⁄K]$ admits a divisor $D$ with $D v = v.\mathrm{ordDifferential}\,\omega = v.\mathrm{ord}(v.\mathrm{differentialCoeff}\,\omega)$ for all places $v$, and that for each place $v$ the differential $d(\text{uniformizer of } v)$ spans $\Omega[F⁄K]$ over $F$. Two hypotheses are imposed as propositions: `FunctionFieldRiemannRoch K F`, asserting that for every nonzero differential $\omega$ and every divisor $D$ one has $\mathrm{ell}(D) - \mathrm{ell}(\mathrm{canonicalDivisorOf}\,\omega - D) = \deg D + 1 - g$, where $g$ is `genus K F`; and `ConstantsAreBase K F`, asserting that the Riemann–Roch space of the zero divisor is exactly the image of $K$ in $F$. Then for any nonzero $\omega \in \Omega[F⁄K]$, the degree of `canonicalDivisorOf hω` (the sum over places of its coefficient times the residue degree $v.\mathrm{deg}$) equals $2g - 2$, where $g$ is `genus K F`, defined as $(\deg(\text{canonical divisor of some chosen nonzero differential}) + 2).\mathrm{toNat}/2$.

--   This is the standard corollary of Riemann–Roch computing the degree of a canonical divisor, here also expressing that the canonical-divisor definition of the genus is consistent with the Riemann–Roch formula and independent of the chosen nonzero differential. It is used downstream in the function-field package, for instance in the versions of the degree and dimension formulas over algebraically closed constant fields and in genus computations for splitting fields.

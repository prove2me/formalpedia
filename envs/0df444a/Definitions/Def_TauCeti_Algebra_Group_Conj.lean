-- statement:
--   For a group $G$, inversion acts on its conjugacy classes; for a monoid, raising representatives to a natural-number power also induces a map on classes:
--
--   $$
--   [g]^{-1}=[g^{-1}],\qquad [g]^j=[g^j].

# Inversion and powers of conjugacy classes, and the size of a class

Inversion of a group is compatible with conjugacy: `x` and `y` are conjugate exactly when `x⁻¹` and
`y⁻¹` are (`TauCeti.isConj_inv_iff`). So inversion descends to the conjugacy classes, where it is an
involution, recorded here as an `InvolutiveInv (ConjClasses G)` instance; `C⁻¹` is the class of the
inverses of the members of `C`, and it has the same size as `C`. A class fixed by this involution is
a **real** class (`TauCeti.IsRealClass`).

Powering likewise commutes with conjugation, so for a **monoid** `M` it too descends to the
conjugacy classes: `ConjClasses.pow C j`, written `C ^ j`, is the class of the `j`-th powers of
the members of `C`.

The other fact collected here is that the size of a conjugacy class is the index of the centralizer
of any of its members, and so divides the order of the group: the orbit-stabilizer theorem for the
conjugation action.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.isConj_inv_iff`: conjugacy is inherited by inverses in both directions.
* `ConjClasses.inv_mk`: the inverse of the class of `g` is the class of `g⁻¹`.
* `TauCeti.IsRealClass`: a class containing an element conjugate to its own inverse, with
  `TauCeti.isRealClass_iff_inv_eq` identifying it with being fixed by inversion.
* `ConjClasses.ncard_carrier_inv` and `ConjClasses.card_carrier_inv`: a conjugacy
  class and its inverse have the same size, in `Set.ncard` and in `Nat.card` form.
* `ConjClasses.ncard_carrier_mk` and `ConjClasses.card_carrier_mk`: the size of a
  conjugacy class is the index of the centralizer of any of its members, in `Set.ncard` and in
  `Nat.card` form.
* `ConjClasses.ncard_carrier_mk_of_mem_center`: the class of a central element is a single
  point.
* `ConjClasses.card_carrier_mul_orderOf_dvd`: the class size times the order of a member
  divides the order of the group, so the quotient below is an exact ratio.
* `ConjClasses.card_div_card_carrier_mul_orderOf_pos`: for a finite group that ratio is positive.
* `ConjClasses.card_div_card_carrier_mul_orderOf_eq_card_centralizer_div_orderOf`: that
  quotient equals the order of the centralizer divided by the order of the member.
* `ConjClasses.one_div_orderOf_div_card_div_card_carrier_mul_orderOf`: dividing `1 / orderOf σ`
  by that quotient, in a semifield of characteristic zero, leaves `#C / #G`.
* `ConjClasses.ncard_carrier_mk_eq_card_filter` and
  `ConjClasses.card_carrier_mk_eq_card_filter`: the size of a conjugacy class as the
  cardinality of a `Finset`, which makes it computable.
* `ConjClasses.card_carrier_dvd_card`: the size of a conjugacy class divides the order of
  the group, with `ConjClasses.card_carrier_cast_ne_zero` the consequence that the size of
  a class is nonzero in any semiring where the group order is, and
  `ConjClasses.card_carrier_div_card_ne_zero` the nonvanishing of `#C / #G` for a finite group.
* `ConjClasses.pow`: the power operation itself, with `C ^ j` its notation.
* `ConjClasses.mem_pow_iff`: an element lies in `C ^ j` exactly when it is a
  `j`-th power of a member of `C`, with `ConjClasses.mk_pow` the computation rule.
* `ConjClasses.pow_zero`, `ConjClasses.pow_one` and
  `ConjClasses.pow_mul`: the identity and composition laws for that power.
* `ConjClasses.map_mk`: the computation rule for `ConjClasses.map` on representatives,
  with `ConjClasses.map_pow` the consequence that the power is natural in the monoid.
* `ConjClasses.mk_ne_mk_of_orderOf_ne`: elements of different orders lie in different conjugacy
  classes.

## Implementation notes

The inversion is an instance rather than a plain function so that the notation `C⁻¹`, the
involutivity lemma `inv_inv` and the reindexing equivalence `Equiv.inv` are all available for
conjugacy classes. Powering is instead a named definition `ConjClasses.pow` with a `Pow` instance
delegating to it, so that the roadmap's `C.pow j` and the notation `C ^ j` are the same function;
the lemmas below are all stated in the `^` form. There is still no
multiplication on `ConjClasses M` — `Pow (ConjClasses M) ℕ` is a bare power operation, not the
`npow` field of a monoid structure, and none of the lemmas here presuppose one.

The power operation is developed for the Chebotarev roadmap (`Chebotarev/README.md` Layer 1,
"consumed Frobenius classes and powers of conjugacy classes", whose `Suggested.lean` pins these
signatures); its consumer there is the von Mangoldt fibre, which sums over the classes `C ^ j`.
That is also why a `pow_two_cyclicFour` regression is kept: a group of
exponent two has no proper nonidentity square, so it cannot separate a correct power operation
from one that collapses to the identity. It is `private`, being a check on this development
rather than reusable conjugacy-class API. This operation is *not* adapted from the
Birkbeck–Brasca `chebotarev-density` development, which works with `ConjClasses.mk` and
`Subgroup.zpowers` directly and never forms `C ^ j`.

The two arithmetic statements concern the quotient `#G / (#C * orderOf σ)`. The first says the
division is exact — `#C` is the index of the centralizer of `σ`, and `orderOf σ` divides that
centralizer's order, so their product divides `#G` — and the second evaluates the quotient as the
centralizer's order over `orderOf σ`. Neither asserts that either side counts anything; a caller
wanting a cardinality interpretation must supply it.

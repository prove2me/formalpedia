-- title:
--   Monic fibres have exactly degΦ roots over ̄ K
-- statement:
--   Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field and let $\Phi$ be a polynomial in one variable whose coefficients are themselves polynomials over $\mathbb{Z}$, i.e. $\Phi \in (\mathbb{Z}[X])[Y]$, and assume $\Phi$ is monic as such, so that its leading coefficient is the constant polynomial $1 \in \mathbb{Z}[X]$. For any point $a \in K$, form the fibre polynomial `fibrePoly` $\Phi\, a \in K[Y]$, obtained by applying to each coefficient of $\Phi$ the ring homomorphism $\mathbb{Z}[X] \to K$ that sends integers to $K$ along the canonical map and sends $X$ to $a$; concretely, it is $\Phi(a, Y)$ regarded as a one-variable polynomial over $K$. The assertion is that the multiset of roots of this fibre polynomial in $K$, that is the roots counted with their multiplicities, has cardinality equal to the degree of $\Phi$ in the variable $Y$. Note that the monicity hypothesis is used both to keep the fibre polynomial nonzero and to preserve its degree under specialisation, so the count is the full expected one at every point $a$, with no exceptional fibres.

--   This is the uniform fibre count for a monic correspondence: specialising a monic $\Phi \in (\mathbb{Z}[X])[Y]$ at any point of an algebraically closed field leaves a polynomial of unchanged degree, all of whose roots lie in the field. It supplies the root count used by [`ModularCurve.ModularPolynomialData.mem_of_isRoot_map_j_of_transcendental`](thm.html#ModularCurve.ModularPolynomialData.mem_of_isRoot_map_j_of_transcendental) and [`ModularCurve.ModularPolynomialData.mem_of_isRoot_map_j_of_transcendental_of_odd`](thm.html#ModularCurve.ModularPolynomialData.mem_of_isRoot_map_j_of_transcendental_of_odd), where the roots of the specialised modular polynomial at a transcendental $j$-invariant must be exhausted.

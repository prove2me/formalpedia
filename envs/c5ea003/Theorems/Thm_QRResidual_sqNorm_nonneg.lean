# Why a feature lifts R²: the exact residual-projection identity

Experiment 477 reports that adding the QR footprint feature to a fitted per-`N` yield
dial lifts the out-of-sample `R²` from `0.3927` to `0.5691`, and interprets this as a
refutation of the null hypothesis "H3: the residual contains nothing systematic".

This file supplies the exact optimisation theory behind that inference, for a finite
design (a finite sample of moduli).  Everything is elementary but exact: no asymptotics,
no distributional assumptions.

Main results.

* `sqNorm_sub_smul_eq` — the projection identity
  `‖r − t·v‖² = ‖r‖² − ⟨r,v⟩²/‖v‖²` at the optimal step `t = ⟨r,v⟩/‖v‖²`.
* `rss_mono` — enlarging the model class never increases the residual sum of squares
  (hence never decreases `R²`): `rsq_mono`.
* `rss_augment_le` — **quantitative lift**: augmenting a fit `g` by a feature `v`
  decreases the RSS by at least `⟨r,v⟩²/‖v‖²`, where `r = y − g` is the residual.
* `rsq_augment_ge`, `rsq_augment_strict` — the corresponding `R²` lift, and its
  strictness exactly when the residual correlates with the new feature.
* `residual_orthogonal_of_no_lift` — **the H3 dichotomy**: if augmenting by `v` produces
  no `R²` lift at all, then the residual is *exactly orthogonal* to `v`.  So an observed
  lift is not a fitting artefact: it is a certificate that the residual carried structure
  aligned with the feature.

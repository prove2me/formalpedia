# The symmetric Rademacher Wigner ensemble and its spectral moments

This file constructs a concrete Wigner ensemble — the uniform measure on real
symmetric `N × N` sign matrices with zero diagonal — and computes the first
nontrivial normalised spectral moments of `W/√N` by the moment method:

* the second moment is **deterministically** `1 - 1/N` (self-averaging), and
* the expected fourth moment is exactly `(N-1)(2N-3)/N²`.

Both converge to the corresponding moments of the Wigner semicircle law,
`C₁ = 1` and `C₂ = 2` (see `Probability.WignerSemicircleMoments`), which is the
moment-method statement of the semicircle law at orders 2 and 4.

The key probabilistic input is a *sign-flip involution*: if some edge of the
closed walk `i → j → k → l → i` is traversed an odd number of times, flipping
the corresponding Rademacher variable negates the summand, so the expectation
vanishes.  This replaces the usual independence/factorisation argument by an
exact combinatorial symmetry.

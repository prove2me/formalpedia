# A Formal Framework for the Chebotarev Geodesic Theorem (non-split case)

Motivated by the paper *"Chebotarev geodesic theorem: non-split case"*, which proves the
geodesic analogue of the Chebotarev density theorem for congruence subgroups of indefinite
quaternion orders with error exponent `25/36 + ε`, and deduces from it the prime geodesic
theorem with the same exponent.

The analytic input of such papers (spectral theory of the Laplacian, Kuznetsov/Selberg trace
formulae, bounds for exponential sums) is far outside the reach of a formal library today.
What *is* formalizable — and what is the actual logical skeleton of the deduction
"Chebotarev with exponent θ ⟹ prime geodesic theorem with exponent θ" — is the calculus of
**error exponents** together with the **group-theoretic bookkeeping** of conjugacy classes and
the **linear-algebraic character/orthogonality reduction** which converts the non-split problem
into the split one.

This file develops that skeleton rigorously:

* `HasErrorExponent π M θ` : `π x = M x + O(x^{θ+ε})` for every `ε > 0`;
* the exponent calculus: monotonicity, sums, scalar multiples, finite sums, finite
  linear combinations, and perturbation by lower-order terms;
* `exponent_of_inverse_transform`: if an *invertible* linear transform (a "character table")
  of a family of counting functions satisfies the estimate, then so does every member of the
  family.  This is the abstract form of the reduction of the non-split case to the split case;
* `classDensity` for a finite group, `sum_classDensity`, and
  `prime_geodesic_of_chebotarev`: summing the Chebotarev asymptotics over all conjugacy
  classes yields the prime geodesic theorem with the same exponent;
* `tendsto_atTop_of_hasErrorExponent`: an error exponent smaller than the growth exponent of
  the main term forces the qualitative Chebotarev statement (each class is hit infinitely
  often);
* the numerical record chain `25/36 < 71/102 < 7/10 < 35/48 < 3/4` and its consequences.

# Canonical discrete path space

This file records the elementary measurable and filtered structure on the
discrete path space `ℕ → α`.  It does not equip paths with a probability law or
assert any Markov property.

## Main definitions

* `DiscretePath`: the canonical space of `α`-valued discrete paths.
* `DiscretePath.coordinate`: evaluation of a path at one time.
* `DiscretePath.coordinateProcess`: the canonical coordinate process.
* `DiscretePath.canonicalFiltration`: the natural filtration of the coordinate process.

# Nested tie profiles: the zero-fit dial when *both* sides are tied

Cycle 2 of the round-61 investigation.  `Novelty.ZeroFitDialU64` established the
tie-attenuation law for a tied statistic `T` measured against a tie-*refining*
response, and showed that at bitlen 64 the 2-adic tie ceiling
(`≈ 0.9258`) is far above the recorded dial (`0.648`), so tie granularity of the
zero-count statistic cannot explain the observed decline of the dial.

The natural next suspect is granularity of the **response**.  Here we prove the
two-sided law for *nested* profiles: if one variable's tie blocks refine the
other's, then

`ρ² = (V - T_coarse) / (V - T_fine)`,  where `V = (n³-n)/12`

and `T_•` are the Kendall tie corrections of the two profiles.  The one-sided law
is the special case `T_fine = 0`.

## Main results

* `spNest_eq_ssR_coarse` — the midrank collapse identity survives nesting:
  the centred cross-product of the two midrank vectors equals the *coarse*
  between-block sum of squares.
* `nested_spearmanSq_eq` — the two-sided attenuation law.
* `tieCorr_flatten_le` — refinement decreases the tie correction (superadditivity
  of `m ↦ m³ - m`), hence `nested_spearmanSq_le_one`.
* `nested_of_fine_tiefree` — the one-sided law is recovered.
* `binary_response_spearmanSq` — **exact** ceiling for a binary response with
  `j` positives and `k` negatives against a tie-free statistic:
  `ρ² = 3jk/((j+k)² - 1)`, i.e. asymptotically `ρ = √(3q(1-q))`.
* `balanced_binary_ceiling` — the balanced binary ceiling `ρ² = 3j²/(4j²-1) > 3/4`
  (`ρ → √3/2 ≈ 0.8660`).
* `u64_binary_calibration` — the recorded pooled reading `0.648` is reproduced to
  `10⁻⁴` by a binary response with base rate `16.83 %`; combined with
  `u64_binary_rate_forced`, any binary response with base rate above `25 %` is
  *excluded* by the measurement.

The scientific content is a falsifiable prediction: under the response-granularity
explanation of the dial's decline, the bitlen-64 rate variable must be
(effectively) a two-class variable with minority mass near `17 %`, and the dial can
never exceed `√3/2` regardless of bitlen.

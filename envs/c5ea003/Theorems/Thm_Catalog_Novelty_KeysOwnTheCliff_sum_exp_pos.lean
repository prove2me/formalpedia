# Keys own the cliff: the structural asymmetry of KV-cache quantisation (NET-93)

The NET-93 measurement (llama-perplexity, ctx = 2048, 250KB held-out wikitext
slice) produced a four-order-of-magnitude asymmetry between the two halves of
the attention cache:

| arm            | PPL      | dPPL vs control |
|----------------|----------|-----------------|
| K q4_1 / V q4_1| 3158.07  | +44,322%        |
| K iq4_nl/V iq4_nl | 1627.35 | +22,790%      |
| K q4_0 / V f16 | 2537.80  | +35,597%        |
| K f16 / V q4_0 | 7.1211   | +0.166%         |

Two claims were extracted:

* **P1 (refuted empirically).**  A richer 4-bit block format (scale + offset
  `q4_1`, or the nonuniform codebook `iq4_nl`) rescues the keys.  It does not.
* **P2 (confirmed beyond prediction).**  Keys are astronomically more sensitive
  than values; the measured damage ratio is ~2.1 · 10⁵, not the predicted ≥ 5.

This file proves that both facts are *theorems about the attention functional*,
not artefacts of one implementation family inside `llama.cpp`.

Main results.

* `attn_value_perturbation_le` — **values are free, unconditionally.**  Softmax
  weights form a convex combination, so a `δ`-perturbation of the value cache
  moves the attention output by at most `δ`: the map is `1`-Lipschitz in the
  values, with no dependence on the query, the scores, the context length or
  the depth.  (`attn_value_perturbation_sharp`: the constant `1` is attained.)
* `score_error_le_of_key_error` / `score_error_dim_amplified` — **keys are
  amplified before the nonlinearity.**  A key perturbation is contracted with
  the query, so a `δ`-perturbation of the keys moves the *logits* by up to
  `‖q‖₁ · δ`, and this dimension-times-query-norm amplification is attained.
* `key_quantization_annihilates` — for *every* resolution `δ > 0` there is a
  configuration in which a `δ`-key-perturbation moves the output by at least
  `1/4`, i.e. by a constant independent of `δ`.
* `damage_ratio_unbounded` — hence the K-vs-V damage ratio admits **no finite
  upper bound**: the measured 2.1 · 10⁵ is not a ceiling.
* `no_codebook_rescues_keys` — **P1, refuted structurally.**  For *any* key
  quantiser whatsoever whose per-block codebook has at most `N` entries —
  uniform `q4_0`, affine `q4_1`, nonuniform `iq4_nl`, or any format not yet
  invented — there are two keys separated by at least `1/N` that the codebook
  identifies, and a query of norm at most `2N` under which the exact attention
  output and the quantised one differ by at least `1/4`.  Only the *cardinality*
  of the codebook enters; no amount of representational cleverness helps.
* `value_codebook_damage_le` — the contrast: the same pigeonhole argument
  applied to a value codebook of resolution `δ` yields damage at most `δ`.

The mechanism the theorems isolate is exactly the one conjectured in NET-93:
key error enters *multiplicatively, upstream of the softmax*, where it is scaled
by the query norm and then passed through a selection nonlinearity; value error
enters *additively, downstream*, where a convex combination averages it away.

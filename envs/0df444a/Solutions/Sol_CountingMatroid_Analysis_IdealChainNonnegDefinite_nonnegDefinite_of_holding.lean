          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# The Dirichlet form, the Poincaré inequality, and positive semidefiniteness

Where `Var_μ(f)` measures the *global* variation of `f`, the Dirichlet form
`ℰ_P(f)` measures its *local* variation along the edges of the transition graph
`(Ω, P)`.  The entire mixing-time theory is the comparison of the two: a chain
mixes quickly exactly when local variation controls global variation, which is
the Poincaré inequality `γ · Var_μ(f) ≤ ℰ_P(f)`.

* `dirichlet μ P f g` — the bilinear form `⟪f, (I - P) g⟫_μ`; the Dirichlet form
  proper is the quadratic case `dirichlet μ P f f`.
* `sum_pair_sq` — the workhorse: for a *stationary* `μ` and any `s : ℝ`,
  `∑ x, ∑ y, μ x * P x y * (f x + s * f y) ^ 2 = (1 + s²)⟪f,f⟫ + 2s⟪f, Pf⟫`.
  Specialising to `s = -1` gives the pair form of the Dirichlet form, and to
  `s = 1` the lower bound `-⟪f,f⟫ ≤ ⟪f, Pf⟫`.  Both signs matter: one says the
  chain is a contraction, the other that it cannot overshoot.
* `dirichlet_self_eq_pair` — `ℰ_P(f) = ½ ∑_{x,y} μ(x) P(x,y) (f x - f y)²`, the
  paper's definition, here a theorem.
* `SpectralGapAtLeast μ P γ` — the Poincaré inequality.  Following the source
  monograph we take this *as* the definition of the spectral gap: for reversible
  chains it agrees with `1 - λ₂`, and for non-reversible ones it is the right
  notion anyway (the "Poincaré constant"), so no eigenvalue is ever needed.
* `NonnegDefinite μ P` — `0 ≤ ⟪f, P f⟫_μ` for all `f`, the PSD condition.  This
  is what upgrades the spectral gap to the *absolute* spectral gap, and hence
  what makes the gap control the decay of variance; see
  `Arlib.MarkovChains.Techniques.SpectralGap`.

The pay-off proved here is `ip_act_le_of_gap`: on a mean-zero function a chain
with gap `γ` which is PSD satisfies `|⟪f, P f⟫_μ| ≤ (1 - γ) ⟪f, f⟫_μ`, the
two-sided bound that drives everything downstream.

Everything here is proved from first principles with no `sorry`; in particular
no eigenvalue, and no spectral theorem, appears anywhere.

/-! ## The Dirichlet form -/





/-! ## The pair expansion

Everything about the Dirichlet form flows from a single computation: expanding
`∑_{x,y} μ(x) P(x,y) (f x + s · f y)²` for a stationary `μ`.  The `f x²` term is
resummed with `∑_y P x y = 1`, the `f y²` term with stationarity, and the cross
term is `⟪f, P f⟫_μ` on the nose. -/







/-! ## Two-sided control of `⟪f, P f⟫_μ`

A stochastic kernel is a contraction on `L²(μ)`: taking `s = -1` above bounds
`⟪f, P f⟫_μ` from above by `⟪f, f⟫_μ`, and taking `s = 1` bounds it from below
by `-⟪f, f⟫_μ`.  These are the elementary substitutes for "all eigenvalues lie
in `[-1, 1]`". -/

occurs as a subterm. -/

/-! ## The spectral gap -/









/-! ## Positive semidefinite chains

A chain is *positive semidefinite* when `0 ≤ ⟪f, P f⟫_μ` for every `f` — the
elementary rendering of "all eigenvalues are nonnegative".  Heat-bath block
dynamics (in particular the Glauber dynamics) are PSD, and it is exactly this
that makes the spectral gap equal to the *absolute* spectral gap and hence makes
the gap control the decay of variance. -/

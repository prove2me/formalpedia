# Harmonic bulk × steeper edge: rigidity and mixture resolution for discrete power-law kernels

This file formalises the "harmonic bulk × steeper-edge kernel" refinement question:
a fitted bulk exponent (near the harmonic value `a = 1`, empirically `1.104`) coexists
with head statistics (edge fraction, first-decile mass, peak/end ratio) that each imply a
*steeper* exponent.  The mathematical content developed here is:

* **MLR ⇒ FOSD for the discrete power-law family.**  For weights `k ↦ k^(-a)` on
  `{1, …, n}`, a larger exponent puts more mass on every head window
  (`headMass_le_of_exponent_le`), strictly so (`headMass_lt_of_exponent_lt`).
* **Rigidity / identifiability.**  A single head statistic determines the exponent
  uniquely (`exponent_unique_of_headMass_eq`); hence two head windows reporting
  *different* implied exponents cannot be reconciled by any single power law
  (`no_single_exponent_fits_two_windows`).  This is the exact logical shape of the
  recorded tension.
* **Two-component resolution.**  For a mixture of a flat (bulk) and a steep (edge)
  component, every local exponent lies strictly between the two component exponents
  (`localExp_mix_mem_Ioo`), the head mass is a strict mediant
  (`headMass_mix_mem_Ioo`), and the steep component's local share is strictly
  decreasing in the index (`steepShare_strictAnti`) with limit `0`
  (`steepShare_tendsto_zero`).  So the steep component is *exactly* an edge phenomenon
  while the bulk is governed by the flat exponent.
* **A quantitative instance of the tension and its resolution.**  No power law with
  exponent `≤ 1.104` can produce the recorded peak/end ratio `2.54`
  (`pure_power_law_peak_end_lt_observed`), while the explicit harmonic-bulk /
  quadratic-edge mixture with weight `w = 54/127` produces it exactly
  (`harmonic_edge_mixture_matches_observed_peak_end`).

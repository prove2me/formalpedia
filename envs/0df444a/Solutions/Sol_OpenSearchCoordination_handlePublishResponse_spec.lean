/-- `handlePublishResponse` returns a commit only when the publish votes, after `addVote` of the sender, are a quorum of
both the last committed configuration (read now) and the configuration being published; the commit is for the current
term and the version being published, and is sent by this node. (Only this direction is stated.) -/

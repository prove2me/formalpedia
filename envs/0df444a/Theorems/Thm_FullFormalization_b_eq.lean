-- title:
--   Star weights are forward differences of the interpolation weights
-- statement:
--   For a step count $N$ and an index $j \ge 1$, the star weight is the difference of consecutive interpolation weights:
--   $$b_j = a_j - a_{j-1}.$$
--   Here $a_j = H_j / D_{j+1}$ is the weight multiplying the adjacent interpolation residual $I_{j,j+1}$, subject to the source's endpoint conventions $a_N = 1$ and $a_{-1} = 0$, while $b_j$ is the weight multiplying the residual $I_{\star,j}$ measured from the minimiser. The hypothesis $1 \le j$ excludes exactly the index $j = 0$, at which the defining difference degenerates to $a_0 - a_{-1} = a_0$ and the index $-1$ is not available in $\mathbb{N}$.

  FullFormalization.CoefficientIdentities

  Source: section 5, Lemma 5.1, of
  `auditable_full_proof_nag_and_five_algorithm_cn.md`.

    (5.1)  H_j - H_{j-1} = h_j
    (5.2)  H_{N-1} = d_N
    (5.3)  h_j = 1 + m_j h_{j+1}            (source index range j < N-1)
    (5.4)  h_{N-1} = 1 + m_{N-1}
    (5.5)  D_j - D_{j+1} = (j+3)/4          (j >= 1)
    (5.6)  D_{j+2} = D_{j+1} - 1 - m_j (D_j - D_{j+1})     (j >= 1)

  Every one of these is a *symbolic* identity in `N` and the running index.
  There is no finite enumeration and no numerical substitution anywhere: the
  index appears as a universally quantified natural number and the proofs are
  rational-function identities closed by `field_simp`/`ring`.

  Index convention.  Statements that in the source use `j - 1` are phrased
  here in a positive-index form (with `j = k + 1`) so that the Lean statement
  carries no truncated natural-number subtraction; the literal `j - 1` form is
  recorded as a corollary in each case, so that the transcription to the source
  stays checkable.

  Lemma 5.1 in the source states (5.3) only for `j < N-1`, but the underlying
  rational-function identity is unconditional; the source's `j = N-1` instance
  is (5.4).  The unconditional form is recorded, and the source's restricted
  form follows by specialisation.  This strengthens an *intermediate* lemma
  only; no source theorem statement is altered.

  Also recorded here are the two `a`-side relations that the telescoping
  certificate uses, (10.6) and its companion, which follow from (5.1) by
  clearing the denominators `D_j, D_{j+1}, D_{j+2}`.

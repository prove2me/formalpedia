# The Friendship Theorem

## Definitions and Statement
- A `Friendship` graph is one in which any two distinct vertices have exactly one neighbor in common
- A `Politician`, at least in the context of this problem, is a vertex in a graph which is adjacent
  to every other vertex.
- The friendship theorem (Erdős, Rényi, Sós 1966) states that every finite friendship graph has a
  politician.

## Proof outline
The proof revolves around the theory of adjacency matrices, although some steps could equivalently
be phrased in terms of counting walks.
- Assume `G` is a finite friendship graph.
- First we show that any two nonadjacent vertices have the same degree
- Assume for contradiction that `G` does not have a politician.
- Conclude from the last two points that `G` is `d`-regular for some `d : ℕ`.
- Show that `G` has `d ^ 2 - d + 1` vertices.
- By casework, show that if `d = 0, 1, 2`, then `G` has a politician.
- If `3 ≤ d`, let `p` be a prime factor of `d - 1`.
- If `A` is the adjacency matrix of `G` with entries in `ℤ/pℤ`, we show that `A ^ p` has trace `1`.
- This gives a contradiction, as `A` has trace `0`, and thus `A ^ p` has trace `0`.

# Chapter 40: Of friends and politicians

From "Proofs from THE BOOK":

**Friendship theorem** (Erdős–Rényi–Sós 1966): In a finite graph where every two
distinct vertices have exactly one common neighbor, there exists a vertex adjacent
to all others (a "politician").

The book's proof uses spectral graph theory: the adjacency matrix A
satisfies A² = J + (k-1)I. The graph is d-regular; eigenvalue analysis and
a characteristic polynomial argument over 𝔽_p (for p | d-1) yields contradiction
unless d ≤ 2, which is handled separately.

# The zero-fit dial at bitlen 76: the `p`-adic ceiling law and the effective base

## Research context (FACT round-65 #1, exp 533, `U76-DIAL-CONFIRMED`)

The measurement under study reports a Spearman rank correlation between a
*zero-count statistic* `T` (the number of trailing zeros of a uniformly drawn
integer) and a downstream `rate`, on uniform draws at bitlen 76:

* seeds 20261170/71/72 give `0.593 / 0.618 / 0.612`;
* pooled `0.608`, CI `[0.588, 0.631]`, all inside the validation band `[0.55, 0.85]`;
* `T` beats a plain count statistic by `+0.073`, CI `[0.045, 0.097]`;
* the dial is reported *flat within noise* from bitlen 72 to bitlen 76.

`Novelty.ZeroFitDialU64` proved the tie-attenuation law
`ρ² = 1 - 12·Σⱼ(mⱼ³-mⱼ)/(n³-n)` and evaluated it for the *dyadic* profile.
This file supplies the two pieces of mathematics that the round-65 report needs
and that the earlier files do not contain.

## Main results

* `padicBlocks`, `padicBlocks_sum` — the tie profile of the base-`p` trailing-zero
  statistic on `{0,…,p^b-1}`: blocks `(p-1)p^{b-1}, …, (p-1)p, (p-1)` and the
  singleton `{0}`.
* `tieCorr_padic` — closed form for the Kendall tie correction of that profile.
* `padic_spearmanSq` — the **`p`-adic ceiling law**
  `ρ²(p,b) = (3p/(p²+p+1)) · (1 + 1/(p^b(p^b+1)))`,
  which specialises at `p = 2` to the dyadic value `(6/7)(1+1/(2^b(2^b+1)))`
  (`padicBlocks_two`, `padic_two_eq_dyadic`).
* `padicLimit_strict_anti`, `padic_ceiling_gt_limit`, `padic_ceiling_close` — the
  base-`p` ceiling `3p/(p²+p+1)` is strictly decreasing in `p`, and the finite-`b`
  ceiling approaches it from above at rate `p^{-2b}`.
* `dial_flat_72_76` — the **flatness theorem**: the dyadic ceiling changes by less
  than `10^{-43}` between bitlen 72 and bitlen 76, so no tie mechanism can produce
  *any* bitlen dependence in that range.
* `tie_mechanism_excluded_64_76` — the recorded drop `0.648 → 0.608` exceeds the
  entire ceiling change from bitlen 64 to bitlen 76 by a factor `> 10^{30}`.
* `effective_base_seven` — the **effective-base inversion**: `p = 7` is the *unique*
  base whose asymptotic ceiling `3p/(p²+p+1)` lies inside the square of the observed
  seed range `[0.593, 0.618]`; and the finite ceiling at bitlen 76 also lies there
  (`padic_seven_76_in_seed_window`).
* Recorded-data theorems `u76_inside_band`, `u76_pooled_near_seed_mean`,
  `u76_below_tie_ceiling`, `u76_count_gap_positive`.

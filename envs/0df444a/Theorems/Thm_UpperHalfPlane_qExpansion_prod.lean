-- title:
--   q-expansion of a finite product of functions on H
-- statement:
--   Fix a real number $h$ (the width of the $q$-parameter $q = e^{2\pi i \tau/h}$), an index type $\iota$, a finite subset $s$ of $\iota$, and a family $F : \iota \to \mathbb{H} \to \mathbb{C}$ of complex-valued functions on the upper half-plane. Assume that for every $i \in s$ the associated cusp function `cuspFunction h (F i)` — the function $q \mapsto F_i(\mathrm{invQParam}\ h\ q)$ on the punctured disc, extended to $q = 0$ by the limit of that function as $q \to 0$ — is analytic at $0$ as a function of the complex variable $q$. The conclusion is an identity in the power series ring $\mathbb{C}[[q]]$: the $q$-expansion of the pointwise product $\prod_{i \in s} F_i$, namely the Taylor series at $q = 0$ whose $n$-th coefficient is the $n$-th iterated derivative of the cusp function at $0$ divided by $n!$, equals the product $\prod_{i \in s}$ `qExpansion h (F i)` of the individual $q$-expansions. No periodicity, holomorphy or modularity of the $F_i$ is assumed beyond analyticity of the cusp functions at $0$; the empty product is covered, the statement then reducing to $q$-expansion of the constant function $1$.

--   This is the finite-product form of the two-factor multiplicativity of $q$-expansions, `qExpansion_mul`: the passage from a function on the upper half-plane to its Taylor series in the local parameter at the cusp is a ring homomorphism on functions whose cusp functions are analytic at the cusp. It is used in the vanishing criterion [`ModularForm.eq_zero_of_lt_order_qExpansion_of_isArithmetic`](thm.html#ModularForm.eq_zero_of_lt_order_qExpansion_of_isArithmetic), where one compares the order of vanishing at $\infty$ of a modular form with that of a product of its translates.

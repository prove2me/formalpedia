-- title:
--   OAI.TranslativeCovering.periodization_exact: intermediate lemma from OpenAI, The optimal order of convex-body covering density
-- statement:
--   An intermediate lemma of the split of OpenAI's proof of `OAI.CoveringOrder.optimal_order`, carved from OpenAI's openai/math development for this platform. The statement and its proof are OpenAI's (OpenAI, *The optimal order of convex-body covering density*, OpenAI Math Release, September 23, 2026, result family 92, [github.com/openai/math](https://github.com/openai/math), Apache License 2.0); in Lean it is the declaration `OAI.TranslativeCovering.periodization_exact` of [lean/OAI/Geometry/TranslativeCovering/DistinctCosets.lean](https://github.com/openai/math/blob/adc7f1241b42e322a6451854ab7e4b4c146bf78a/lean/OAI/Geometry/TranslativeCovering/DistinctCosets.lean) at commit adc7f12, ported to Lean 4.33.1 and Mathlib 0df444a.

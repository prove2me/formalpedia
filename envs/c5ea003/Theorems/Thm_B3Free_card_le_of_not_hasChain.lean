-- statement:
--   **Mirsky-type bound.**  A family with no chain of `k + 1` sets has at most
--   `k · C(n, ⌊n/2⌋)` members: peel off the maximal sets, which form an antichain, and use
--   Sperner's theorem.

# Maximality of layer families, exact values, and a general upper bound for `La(n, B_d)`

This file continues `Catalog/Bridges/B3FreeFamilies.lean`, which sets up the framework of
weak/strong `P`-free families surrounding the paper *On the maximum size of `B_3`-free
families*.

## Main results

* `not_strongFree_insert_layers`, `layers_maximal_weakFree`, `layers_maximal_strongFree` —
  **maximality of the layer construction**: adding to `d` consecutive layers any set whose
  size lies outside the corresponding interval creates a strong (hence weak) copy of `B_d`.
  Consequently an `ε`-improvement can never be obtained by enlarging the layer family.
* `La_boolLat_eq_of_card_eq_succ`, `LaStar_boolLat_eq_of_card_eq_succ`, `La_boolLat3_fin4` —
  the exact value `La(d+1, B_d) = La*(d+1, B_d) = 2^(d+1) - 2`, attained by the `d` layers
  `1, …, d`; in particular `La(4, B_3) = 14`.  Hence `La` and `La*` agree for `n ∈ {d, d+1}`
  (`La_eq_LaStar_of_card_eq_succ`).
* `La_boolLat_lt_succ_of_card_eq_succ`, `La_boolLat3_lt_boolLat4_fin4` — strict
  monotonicity `La(d+1, B_d) < La(d+1, B_(d+1))`.
* `not_hasChain_of_weakFree`, `card_le_of_not_hasChain`, `La_boolLat_le` — a chain of
  `2^d` sets contains a weak copy of `B_d`, and a Mirsky-type peeling of maximal sets
  combined with Sperner's theorem gives the **general upper bound**
  `La(n, B_d) ≤ (2^d - 1) · C(n, ⌊n/2⌋)`; for `d = 3` this brackets the paper's quantity,
  `3 · C(n, ⌊n/2⌋-2) ≤ La(n, B_3) ≤ 7 · C(n, ⌊n/2⌋)` (`La_boolLat3_bounds`).

/-! ## Maximality of the layer families

The `d`-layer construction is not only weak `B_d`-free: it is a *maximal* such
family.  Adding any further set to `layers α a d` creates a strong (hence also a
weak) copy of `B_d`.  So the `ε`-improvement of Ellis–Ivan–Leader (and of the
`B_3` paper) can never be obtained by enlarging the layer family; sets have to be
deleted first.

/-! ## An exact value: ground set of size `d + 1`

On a ground set with `d + 1` elements the extremal family is again a family of
layers, namely all sets except `∅` and the ground set: `La(d+1, B_d) = 2^(d+1) - 2`.

/-! ## Chains, Mirsky-type partitions, and a general upper bound

A chain of `2^d` sets already contains a weak copy of `B_d` (map `B_d` into the chain
along the binary-encoding linear extension), so a weak `B_d`-free family has no chain of
`2^d` sets.  Peeling off maximal elements (a Mirsky-type argument) and applying Sperner's
theorem to each layer of maximal elements gives the general upper bound
`La(n, B_d) ≤ (2^d − 1) · C(n, ⌊n/2⌋)`.

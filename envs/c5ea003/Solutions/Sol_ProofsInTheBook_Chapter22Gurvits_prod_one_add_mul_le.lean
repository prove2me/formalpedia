# Permanent convexity lemmas

This file is independent of `Chapter22`.  It records algebraic permanent
facts used in Van der Waerden-style arguments:

* additivity and affine-linearity in one row or one column;
* bilinearity of the permanent after two rows are singled out;
* the quadratic expansion along a two-row line, and the resulting convexity
  criterion when the mixed quadratic coefficient is nonnegative;
* the discharge of that mixed-coefficient hypothesis for the elementary
  `2 × 2` checkerboard exchange directions;
* the maximal feasible checkerboard exchange step, which keeps the
  doubly-stochastic constraints and forces a boundary zero;
* the elementary `2 × 2` row log-concavity model.

The deep Alexandrov-Fenchel/Falikman-Egorychev/Gurvits log-concavity input is
not hidden here.  The general convexity theorem below states exactly the local
mixed-coefficient nonnegativity hypothesis needed for a two-row slice.

# Chapter 22: Van der Waerden's permanent conjecture

From "Proofs from THE BOOK":

**Van der Waerden's conjecture** (now theorem, proved by Falikman and
Egorychev): The permanent of a doubly stochastic n×n matrix is minimized
by the matrix with all entries 1/n, giving perm ≥ n!/nⁿ.

The book presents the proof using the theory of mixed discriminants.

Formalization status: this file now states the genuine theorem over Mathlib's
`doublyStochastic` predicate.  The proved local part is the equality-case
computation for the flat matrix, the `n ≤ 2` unconditional lower bounds, the
`n = 0,1,2` instances of the coefficient-from-capacity analytic core, and the
weighted-AM-GM capacity lower bound for row-linear products of doubly
stochastic matrices.  It identifies the squarefree coefficient of the
row-linear `MvPolynomial` with the row-linear mixed coefficient and hence with
the permanent, and packages the checkerboard boundary-convexity step for
opposite exchange endpoints.  The remaining arbitrary-dimension lower bound is
exposed as a point-17 honest frontier: it is conditional on the missing
Falikman-Egorychev/Gurvits coefficient-from-capacity inequality for `n ≥ 3`,
now stated on the actual squarefree coefficient of the row-linear polynomial
rather than replaced by the flat-matrix special case.  The equality-only-if-flat
strengthening belongs to the same unformalized analytic equality-case layer.

The exact intended unconditional Lean endpoint is:

```
theorem van_der_waerden_permanent_conjecture (n : ℕ)
    (A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ)
    (hA : A ∈ doublyStochastic ℝ (Fin n)) :
    (n.factorial : ℝ) / (n : ℝ) ^ n ≤ A.permanent
```

### The equality case and the honest analytic frontier

The van der Waerden theorem says every doubly stochastic matrix has permanent
at least `n! / n^n`, with equality at the flat matrix.

/-!
### Elementary low-dimensional cases

The full theorem is deep, but dimensions `0`, `1`, and `2` are elementary.
These results discharge the analytic-core assumption in the small cases instead
of hiding them behind the frontier theorem.

# Real-stable polynomials (toward Chapter 22, Gurvits capacity)

A real multivariate polynomial is **real-stable** if it has no zero with all variables in the
open upper half-plane. This is the polynomial class underlying Gurvits's capacity proof. Here we
build the definition and the closure properties that are elementary (product closure, stability of
nonnegative linear forms — hence of the row-linear product `∏ rows`). The hard remaining closure
(`∂/∂xₘ` preserves real-stability — the Lieb–Sokal lemma) is isolated as `DerivPreservesStable`.

### Univariate real-rootedness and its derivative closure (the univariate Lieb–Sokal heart)

A univariate real polynomial is real-rooted iff it splits over ℝ — equivalently its root multiset
(with multiplicity) has cardinality equal to its degree. The derivative of a real-rooted polynomial
is again real-rooted (Rolle's theorem / interlacing). This is the one-variable case of the stability
closure; the full multivariate Lieb–Sokal lemma (`∂/∂xₘ` preserves real-stability) lifts it via the
Hurwitz theorem and remains the genuine remaining analytic input for the Gurvits reduction.

# Chapter 22 (van der Waerden permanent bound) — Gurvits capacity, algebraic core

The Gurvits capacity proof reduces `perm(A) ≥ n!/nⁿ` (for doubly stochastic `A`) to a chain of
capacity inequalities with reduction constant `G(k) = ((k-1)/k)^{k-1}`. The product of these
constants telescopes to exactly `n!/nⁿ` — that is the algebraic heart proved here. Blueprint:
`HANDOFF/CH22_GURVITS_CAPACITY.md`.

### The AM-GM product bound (key inequality of the univariate Gurvits step)

For nonnegative `λ` and `t`, `∏ᵢ (1 + λᵢ t) ≤ (1 + (Σλ) t / k)^k`. This is AM-GM applied to the
`k` factors `1 + λᵢ t`, and it is the inequality that, evaluated at the optimal `t`, yields the
Gurvits capacity-reduction constant `G(k) = ((k-1)/k)^{k-1}`.
-/









/-!
### Capacity lower-bound bookkeeping for the reduction chain

The analytic-free stable-polynomial step is most convenient to state as a
lower-bound invariant rather than as an actual infimum.  `CapLB p c` means that
`c` is a certified lower bound for the Gurvits capacity of `p`.

/-!
### Algebraic interface to the Chapter 22 capacity core

The analytic Gurvits step should produce the lower bound with the telescoping
product of the constants `G(2), ..., G(n)`.  The theorem below is the purely
algebraic last mile: once that iterated capacity estimate is available for the
row-linear polynomial, the exact `n! / n^n` squarefree-coefficient core follows.

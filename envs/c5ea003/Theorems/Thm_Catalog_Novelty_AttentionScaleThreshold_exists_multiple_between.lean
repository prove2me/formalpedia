# Hinges, grid resolution, and the scale threshold (NET-67, cycle 2)

This is the second research cycle on the NET-67 measurement.  Cycle 1
(`Novelty.AttentionBudgetIncrement`, `Novelty.AttentionRetentionKnee`) fixed the
two measured budget laws, audited the verdict, and derived the additive law from
a decay rate degrading like `1/log(context)`.  Three questions were left open,
and each gets a theorem here.

**(1) How much does the measured triple actually determine?**  The 1.5B curve is
a *hinge* `max 16 (base + slope·j)`.  `hingeFits_iff` characterises all hinges
through the measured points `16, 16, 18`, and the answer is uncomfortable:
`hingeFits_slope_ge_two` shows the data only force `slope ≥ 2`, and
`hingeFits_alternative` exhibits a genuinely different fit (`base = 12`,
`slope = 3`).  So the advertised `+2` is a **lower bound**, not a measurement.
`hinge_prediction_discriminates` shows the two fits separate at the very next
octave (`20` versus `21` keys at `4096`), which is exactly the experiment to run.

**(2) Why did NET-66 read `20` where NET-67 reads `18`?**  Because a knee read
on a coarse grid is the least *grid point* above the true knee.  `kneeMul` is
the grid-restricted knee and `kneeMul_bounds` proves the two-sided estimate
`knee ≤ kneeMul < knee + d`.  `coarse_grid_reads_twenty` realises the NET-66/67
discrepancy exactly: a profile whose true knee is `18` is read as `20` on the
spacing-`4` grid, and the error is provably below the spacing.

**(3) Does the halving extrapolate to 7B?**  Cycle 1 calibrated the peakedness
of the two models to `λ₀ = 1` and `λ₀ = 2` at parameter counts `0.5B` and
`1.5B`, i.e. `λ₀(N) = (2N)^θ` with `θ = log 2 / log 3`.  The induced increment
law `incrAt N = 4·(2N)^(-θ)` reproduces both measurements
(`incrAt_half`, `incrAt_three_halves`), is strictly decreasing
(`incrAt_strictAntiOn`), and has an **exact closed-form threshold**:
`incrAt N < 1 ↔ 4.5 < N` (`incrAt_lt_one_iff`).  Hence
`scale_threshold_four_point_five`: *a model above 4.5B parameters needs less
than one extra key per context doubling* — its attention budget is essentially
context-free.  For the proposed 7B cell the prediction is bracketed exactly:
`1/2 < incrAt 7 < 1` (`prediction_7B`).

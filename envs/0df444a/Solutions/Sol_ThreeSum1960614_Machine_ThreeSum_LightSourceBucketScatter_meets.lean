# Proof rules for the light language

Ends lim P d s σ T Q says: the statement s, started in σ, ends within T steps in a state that
satisfies Q.  There is one rule for each construct; a rule turns a goal about a statement into goals
about its parts, so a proof follows the text of the program from top to bottom.  Recursion needs no
rule: a statement about a recursive procedure is proved by induction (in Lean) on a measure, and the
rule for calls unfolds the body.

There are three rules for loops: with an invariant indexed by the number of the round and a cost for
each round (Ends.while), the same with one cost for all rounds (Ends.whileConst), and, for a loop
whose number of rounds depends on the data, with a quantity that every round decreases
(Ends.whileVariant).

The file also has the basic facts about runs (a run stays a run when procedures are appended to the
program), notation for writing programs, the simplification set
`light_norm`, and the standing assumptions `Std` about the limits.

# Regions of the memory, and the cells that a step leaves alone

A region is given by its first address `a` and its number `n` of cells.  `Inside a n b` says that
the cell `b` lies in it, `Outside a n b` that it does not, and `Apart a n a' n'` that two regions do
not meet.  `InOrder top [(a, n), (a', n'), …]` says that the listed regions lie one behind the other
and end at or below `top`.  All of these abbreviate linear inequalities.

`SameOn K μ μ'` says that the memory `μ'` agrees with `μ` on every cell that satisfies `K`.  It is
the one notion of "these cells are unchanged": a routine promises `SameOn K μ μ'` for the cells
`K` that it leaves alone.  (It is `Set.EqOn μ' μ {b | K b}`, stated with a predicate: the conditions
`K b` that occur are linear inequalities between addresses and are used as such.)  The usual choices
of `K` have names.

* `SameOutside μ μ' a n`: all cells outside one region; `SameOutside2` and `SameOutside3`: all cells
  outside two or three regions.
* `Kept μ μ' fr`: all cells below the free pointer `fr`.
* `KeptBut μ μ' fr out len`: all cells below `fr` outside the region of an output.

## How a fact is carried from one memory to a later one

A predicate `X` about a memory has one lemma of the name `X.keep` and of the form

  `theorem X.keep (h : X μ …) (hs : SameOn K μ μ' := by light_keep) : X μ' …`

where `K` describes the cells that `X` reads; `Seg.keep` is the model.  The argument `hs` has a
default proof.  So `h.keep`, with no argument, stands for "`h` still holds in the memory that is
asked for here".  The default proof `light_keep` uses every hypothesis of the form `SameOn _ ν ν'`
in the context, that is, the promises of the steps that were taken since `h` was obtained, and the
inequalities in the context that say where the regions lie.  In the proofs a promise is named when
the step is taken, as `same₂` in `rintro _ μ₂ ⟨sY, same₂⟩`.

`wrote μ dst f j` is the memory `μ` after a loop has written `f 0`, …, `f (j - 1)` to the cells from
`dst`.

# Local variables as a list

In the proof of a procedure body the state is written out as ⟨frame [a, b, …], μ⟩: the list
holds the local variables 0, 1, …, and all further ones are 0.  An assignment to local x replaces
entry x of the list (setLocal).  The rules of this file treat one statement each.  They are told the
value that is assigned or stored, and they ask for one fact about each expression: that its
evaluation stays within the limits and gives this value (Expr.Gives).  This fact and the comparison
of the costs are proved by default from the hypotheses in the context.  Ends.forFrame and
Ends.forShape are the rules for counting loops in this form.  In the names of the rules, To says
that the state is ⟨frame l, μ⟩.

Locals by name, and locals whose values do not matter:

* `setLocals l [(x, a), (y, b), …]` is the list `l` after the assignments `x := a`, `y := b`, ….
  With the names of the locals for `x`, `y`, … it describes the locals of a procedure by name:
  `setLocals [] [(Size, n), (Bound, U), …]`.
* `updateLocals loc [(x, a), (y, b), …]` is the same for locals that are not given as a list.  A
  lemma about a piece of text that several procedures share is stated for arbitrary locals `loc`.
* `refreshLocals l loc xs` is the list `l` with the entries `xs` read from `loc`.
* `LocalsBut xs l loc` says that `loc` agrees with `frame l` except perhaps at the locals `xs`.  In
  an invariant, `xs` are the scratch variables.  `Ends.asFrame` goes from such locals to a list, and
  `LocalsBut.of_eq` comes back.
* `Ends.pieceTo` and `Ends.pieceToThen` use a lemma about a piece of text that assigns only the
  locals `xs`: afterwards the locals are `refreshLocals l loc' xs`, where `loc'` are the locals of
  which the lemma speaks.  The lemma need not mention the locals that the piece does not assign.
* `Ends.forScratch` is the rule for a counting loop whose body may change the scratch variables
  `xs`: the round says nothing about the locals.

# Segments of the memory

Seg μ a l says that the cells a, a + 1, …, a + l.length - 1 of the memory μ hold the list l.
SegN is Seg for a list of natural numbers, MatAt for a matrix written row by row, VecAt for a vector
of indices.  The file has the lemmas for reading a cell of a segment, writing into it, writing
elsewhere, and for cutting and joining segments.  Each of the four predicates has its lemma `keep`,
which carries it to a later memory.

# Calls

Meets lim P p d vals μ T R is the specification of a procedure: procedure number p of the program P,
run at depth d on the arguments vals in the memory μ, ends within T steps with a result and a memory
that satisfy R. A routine is proved to meet such a specification (Meets.of_body), and a caller uses
the specification only, so that the proof of a caller does not depend on the body of a callee.

The specification of a routine x, as its callers assume it, has the form
`∀ (data) μ, hypotheses → ∀ d, d + k ≤ lim.depth → Meets lim P p d vals μ T R`.  Here k is the
number of levels of calls that x needs below itself, and d, the depth at which the body of x runs,
comes last.

There is one rule for calls, in four forms.  It is told the fact about the callee, from which it
reads the values of the arguments, the time and what holds afterwards, and it asks for what follows
the call.  Three side goals have default proofs: the arguments are safe and have these values, one
more level of calls is allowed, and the time suffices.  Ends.callTo and Ends.callToThen are the rule
for a state ⟨frame l, μ⟩; Ends.callLast and Ends.callThen are the same for local variables that are
not given as a list.

# Exact positions of original indices in retained residue buckets

Counting-sort positions preserve every input incidence. The resulting fiber
segments contain no repeated physical indices even when input values agree.
All inverse-enumeration reasoning is semantic; the actual scatter program
writes these positions using a cursor and never searches an input band.

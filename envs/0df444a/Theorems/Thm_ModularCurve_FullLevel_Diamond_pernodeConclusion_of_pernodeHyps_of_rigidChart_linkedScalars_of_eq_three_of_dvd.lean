--   Descended per-node crossing data at a supersingular end, q=3
-- statement:
--   **Setting.** Let $q$ be a prime with $q=3$, let $M'$ be a nonzero natural number with $q\nmid M'$, and let $\ell_g$ be a prime with $\ell_g\equiv 11\pmod{12}$ and $\ell_g\mid M'$. Let $A$ be a valuation subring of $\overline{\mathbb Q}=\mathrm{AlgebraicClosure}\,\mathbb Q$ with `A.LiesOverPrime q`, i.e. $q$ is a non-unit of $A$. Let $k_0$ be an intermediate field of $\overline{\mathbb Q}/\mathbb Q$ and write $A_0:=A.\mathrm{comap}(k_0\to\overline{\mathbb Q})$ for its contraction to $k_0$; $\pi_0\in k_0$ is an element lying in $A$, and the hypotheses `hdvr`, `hunif`, `hhens`, `hres`, `hκ` require that $A_0$ be a discrete valuation ring with maximal ideal $(\pi_0)$, Henselian, with algebraically closed residue field, and that every element of $A$ be congruent modulo the maximal ideal of $A$ to an element of $k_0\cap A$.
--
--   On the modular side, $W$ is a finite set of places of $\mathrm{modularFunctionFieldC}(\mathrm{ResidueField}\,A)\,M'$ (the field generated over $\mathrm{ResidueField}\,A$ by the $j$-expansions `jqModC` and `jqNModC`), and `hW` says that $W$ consists exactly of the supersingular places `ssPlaces q M'`: those places $w$ that are rational, affine geometric, and have $w.\mathrm{evalAt}(\mathrm{jGeomGen})\in\mathrm{ssJSet}\,q$ (a $j$-invariant all of whose elliptic curves have no nonzero $q$-torsion point). A place $s\in W$ is fixed. Further, $R_0$ is a `ConstantReduction` of $A$ on $\mathrm{modularFunctionFieldBar}\,M'$, the $\overline{\mathbb Q}$-base change of $\mathrm{modularFunctionFieldFull}\,M'$ inside $\overline{\mathbb Q}(\!(\mathsf q)\!)$, with residue field $\mathrm{modularFunctionFieldC}(\mathrm{ResidueField}\,A)\,M'$: thus a valuation subring $R_0.\mathrm{integers}$ of that base-changed field, a surjective residue homomorphism onto $\mathrm{modularFunctionFieldC}(\mathrm{ResidueField}\,A)\,M'$ with kernel the maximal ideal, a map on places preserving degrees, compatibility with $A\to\mathrm{ResidueField}\,A$ on constants, and the order-matching clause. The hypothesis `hle` asserts $\mathrm{modularFunctionFieldBar}\,M'\le \mathrm{fieldBar}\,q\,M'$, and `hR₀` asserts that for Laurent series $y$ over $A$ whose coefficientwise image lies in $\mathrm{modularFunctionFieldBar}\,M'$ that image lies in $R_0.\mathrm{integers}$ and its $R_0$-residue is the coefficientwise reduction of $y$ modulo the maximal ideal of $A$.
--
--   **Level data.** $H_1$ is the subgroup of $(\mathbb Z/q^2M')^\times$ given by `hH₁` as the intersection of `levelH q M'` (the kernel of the unit-group reduction `ZMod.unitsMap (dvd_sq_mul q M')`) with the kernel of reduction $(\mathbb Z/q^2M')^\times\to(\mathbb Z/\ell_g)^\times$. The field $K_\ell$ is an intermediate field of $\mathrm{LaurentSeries}\,k_0$ over $k_0$, equal by `hKℓ` to the $k_0$-base change $\mathrm{laurentBaseChange}\,k_0(\mathrm{xHFunctionField}\,(q^2M')\,H_1)$, and $j_\ell\in K_\ell$ is nonzero and equal, as a Laurent series, to $\mathrm{coeffEmb}\,k_0\,\mathrm{jq}$ (`hjℓ`). The chart algebra is $\mathrm{chartAlgFin}\,A_0\,K_\ell\,j_\ell$, the $A_0$-subalgebra of elements of $K_\ell$ integral over $A_0[j_\ell]$; $y$ is a maximal ideal of it (`hy`) containing the image of $\pi_0$ (`hϖy`). The hypothesis `hss` says $y$ is supersingular: for every algebraically closed field $\Omega$ of characteristic $q$ and every ring homomorphism $\varphi$ from the chart algebra with kernel $y$, $\varphi(\mathrm{jChartFin})\in\mathrm{ssJSet}\,q\,\Omega$. The hypothesis `hover` identifies $y$ with the place $s$: for every $g\in\mathrm{modularFunctionFieldFull}\,M'$ whose base change $\mathrm{coeffEmb}\,\overline{\mathbb Q}\,g$, an element of $\mathrm{modularFunctionFieldBar}\,M'$, lies in $R_0.\mathrm{integers}$, which is regular wherever $\mathrm{jq}$ is (non-negative order at every place of $\mathrm{modularFunctionFieldBar}\,M'$ over $\overline{\mathbb Q}$ at which $\mathrm{jq}$ has non-negative order), and whose $R_0$-residue lies in the valuation subring of $s$, and which, read over $k_0$ through $\mathrm{coeffEmb}\,k_0$, lies in $K_\ell$ and in the chart algebra, and for every $c\in k_0$ with $c\in A$ whose residue in $\mathrm{ResidueField}\,A$ equals $s.\mathrm{evalAt}$ of that residue, the chart element $g-c$ lies in $y$. The hypothesis `hOrbit` says that every maximal ideal $y'$ of the chart algebra containing $\pi_0$ and satisfying this same identification with $s$ is matched with $y$ by a level automorphism: there are $\gamma\in\Gamma(q)\cap\Gamma_0(M')$ and $\tau\in\mathrm{Aut}_{k_0}(K_\ell)$ with `IsLevelAutAt k₀ q ξ q (q^2M') H₁ γ⁻¹ Kℓ τ` (the condition that $\tau$ act on quotients of integral $\mathsf q$-expansions of modular forms of level $\Gamma_{H_1}(q^2M')$ by the slash action of $\mathrm{conjElemN}\,q\,\gamma^{-1}$, for every embedding $k_0\to\mathbb C$ sending $\xi$ to $e^{2\pi i/q}$), such that $\tau$ preserves the chart algebra and $y\leftrightarrow y'$ under $\tau$.
--
--   **Auxiliary arithmetic data.** Also given are: a prime $\ell$ with $3\le\ell$, $\ell\ne q$, $\ell\nmid M'$ (`hℓ`, `hℓ3`, `hℓq`, `hℓM'`); an element $\zeta_0\in k_0$ which is a primitive $(q\ell)$-th root of unity in $\overline{\mathbb Q}$ (`hζ₀`); an element $\varpi_t\in k_0$ lying in $A$ with $\varpi_t^{\,q^2-1}=q\cdot u$ for a unit $u$ of $A$ (`hϖtA`, `hϖt`), together with $\varpi_t'\in A_0$ equal to $\varpi_t$ (`hϖt'`); an intermediate field $K_b$ of $\overline{\mathbb Q}/k_0$ with $K_b=\bot$ (`hKb`) and a valuation subring $A_b$ of $K_b$ whose members are exactly those elements lying in $A$ (`hAb`), with maximal ideal generated by $\varpi_b\ne 0$ (`hϖb`, `hϖb0`); a primitive $q$-th root of unity $\xi\in k_0$ (`hξ`); and the tameness hypothesis `htame` that $\ell_g-1$ be a unit of $A_0$.
--
--   **The rigid chart frame.** $B_t$ is an $A_0$-subalgebra of $K_\ell$, $W_t$ a valuation subring of $K_\ell$ with $B_t\subseteq W_t$ (`hBW`), and the hypothesis `hS1` (a conjunction whose clauses are summarised here) requires: the chart algebra is contained in $B_t$ and $K_\ell$ is its fraction field; $B_t$ is formally smooth and of finite presentation over $A_0$ and $B_t/\pi_0$ has Krull dimension at most $1$; $W_t$ meets $k_0$ exactly in $A_0$, is a discrete valuation ring with maximal ideal generated by $\pi_0$, is the localisation of $B_t$ at that ideal, and $y$ is the contraction of its maximal ideal to the chart algebra; for every algebra structure of $\mathrm{GaloisField}\,q\,2$ on the residue field of $A_0$ there is a surjective ring homomorphism $\rho$ from $B_t$ onto $\mathrm{DrinfeldCurve.CoordRing}\,q(\mathrm{ResidueField}\,A_0)$ with kernel the contraction of the maximal ideal of $W_t$, compatible with constants, and equivariant for level automorphisms attached to $\gamma\in\Gamma_0(M')$ preserving $W_t$ through an element $c\in(\mathrm{GaloisField}\,q\,2)^\times$ with $(\mathrm{redQ}\,q\,\gamma,c)\in\mathrm{hSubgroup}\,q$ acting by $\mathrm{hAction}$, with $c\ne1$ for nontrivial $\tau$ coming from $\Gamma(q)$ and with the same $c$ realised by some $\gamma'\in\Gamma(q)\cap\Gamma_0(M')$ whose matrix part is trivial; $B_t$ is stable under the level automorphisms attached to $\Gamma_0(M')$; every prime of $B_t$ containing $\pi_0$ is the transport of the maximal ideal of $W_t$ by such an automorphism with $\gamma\in\Gamma(q)\cap\Gamma_0(M')$; and $\pi_0$ divides any $b\in B_t$ lying in all these transports.
--
--   Further, $n\ge1$ divides $q+1$ (`hn1`, `hnq`) and equals $2\cdot\mathrm{placeWidthChar}\,q\,M'\,s$ (`hn`), that is twice the quotient of $\mathrm{jWidthChar}\,q$ at the value of $s$ on $\mathrm{jGeomGen}$ by the ramification index $\mathrm{placeRamificationJ}$ at $s$; $\gamma_0\in\Gamma(q)\cap\Gamma_0(M')$ and $\tau_0$ is a level automorphism at $\gamma_0^{-1}$ preserving $W_t$ (`hγ₀Γ`, `hγ₀Γ0`, `hτ₀`, `hτ₀W`); $m\ge1$ with $\pi_0^m=\varpi_t'\cdot(\text{unit of }A_0)$ (`hm1`, `hm`); $\zeta_c$ in the $\pi_0$-adic completion $\widehat{A_0}$ with $\zeta_c^{\,n}=1$ and $\zeta_c^k-1$ a unit for $0<k<n$ (`hζc`, `hζcprim`); the series $\mathrm{jqNModC}\,k_0\,q$ lies in $K_\ell$ (`hjK`) and in the chart algebra (`hjC`), and $\mathrm{jqNModC}\,k_0\,q-a_0$ lies in $y$ for the given $a_0\in A_0$ (`ha₀y`). The hypothesis `hR7` (a long conjunction, summarised here) provides the rigid end structure: $\tau_0$ has exact order $n$ on $B_t$ and every level automorphism preserving $W_t$ agrees on $B_t$ with a power of $\tau_0$; the finite set $\mathrm{ends}$ of subrings of $K_\ell$ has $q+1$ elements, the level automorphisms attached to $\Gamma_0(M')$ preserving $W_t$ permute it transitively, $\tau_0$ preserves each end, and distinct ends are separated by an element which is a non-unit in one and a unit in the other; a finite-type $A_0$-subalgebra $B_c$, stable under the level automorphisms attached to $\Gamma(q)\cap\Gamma_0(M')$, is contained in every end and presents each end as a localisation; a level automorphism mapping an end into $W_t$ preserves $W_t$; each end $\tilde{\mathcal O}$ is contained in $W_t$, is local and noetherian, contains the chart algebra, meets $k_0$ exactly in $A_0$, has its residue classes represented by constants, and carries crossing data, namely elements $c_x,c_y$, a unit $u$, an isomorphism $\iota$ of the adic completion of $\tilde{\mathcal O}$ with $\mathrm{UVCrossingModel}\,\widehat{A_0}\,(\hat\pi_0^{\,m})$ (the quotient of $\widehat{A_0}[\![X_0,X_1]\!]$ by $X_0X_1-\hat\pi_0^{\,m}$), units $\gamma_U,\gamma_V$, an automorphism $\theta_0$ of that model and an inverse $\zeta_c'$ of $\zeta_c$, with $c_xc_y=\pi_0^m u$, $\iota$ sending constants to `const`, $\iota(c_x)=\gamma_U U$, $\iota(c_y)=\gamma_V V$, $c_y$ in and $c_x$ outside the maximal ideal of $W_t$, $\iota(\mathrm{jqNModC}\,k_0\,q-a_0)=w_V V^e$ with $e\ge1$, $\iota$ intertwining $\tau_0$ with $\theta_0$, and the tangent congruences $\theta_0(U)\equiv\zeta_c U$, $\theta_0(V)\equiv\zeta_c' V$ modulo the square of the maximal ideal; together with, for each end, an auxiliary discrete valuation subring $W_x$ of $K_\ell$ (containing the end and the chart, meeting $k_0$ in $A_0$, uniformised by $\pi_0$, with Eisenstein-type coefficient separation for a parameter $t$ and for $\mathrm{jqNModC}$, with $c_x$ in and $c_y$ outside its maximal ideal, detecting $y$ on the chart, excluding the other ends, and separating ends under level automorphisms) and a finite-type $A_0$-subalgebra $B_x$ of $B_t$ contained in the end, stable under level automorphisms, with poles controlled by those of $j_\ell$, presenting the end as a localisation and containing an Igusa-type separating element; and finally: every valuation subring $V$ of $K_\ell$ meeting $k_0$ in $A_0$, containing the chart algebra and with $y$ inside its maximal ideal, either contains $B_t$ or dominates one of the ends. The hypothesis `hR9` provides an element of $B_t$ lying outside every valuation subring of $K_\ell$ that meets $k_0$ in $A_0$, has $\pi_0$ in its maximal ideal and at which $j_\ell$ is non-integral in the stated monic-polynomial sense; `hR10` provides, for every maximal ideal $y''$ of the chart algebra containing $\pi_0$ which is not matched with $y$ by any level automorphism attached to $\Gamma(q)\cap\Gamma_0(M')$, an element of $B_t$ outside every valuation subring containing the chart in which the transport of $y''$ is swallowed by the maximal ideal.
--
--   **Descent data.** $G$ is the subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut}_{k_0}(K_\ell)$ generated by the level automorphisms attached to $\gamma\in\Gamma(q)\cap\Gamma_0(M')$ (`hG`), $K_0=K_\ell^G$ is the fixed field (`hK₀`), $B_0=B_t\cap K_\ell^{G}$ (`hB₀`), and $W_0'$ is the valuation subring of $K_0$ consisting of the elements lying in $W_t$ (`hW₀'`). A finite set $\mathrm{nodes}$ of subrings of $K_0$ is given, $\tilde{\mathcal O}\in\mathrm{ends}$ (`hÕ`), and $\mathcal O$ is the subring of $K_0$ whose elements are those lying in $\tilde{\mathcal O}$ (`hO`). The derived hypotheses are: `hGfin` ($G$ finite), `hτ₀G` ($\tau_0\in G$), `hGatt` (every element of $G$ is a level automorphism at some $\gamma^{-1}$ with $\gamma\in\Gamma(q)\cap\Gamma_0(M')$), `hτ₀n` ($\tau_0^n=\mathrm{id}$ on $K_\ell$), `hHcyc` (every $\sigma\in G$ preserving $\tilde{\mathcal O}$ acts as a power of $\tau_0$), `hInvFin` (for a finite-type $G$-stable $B_x$ and its ring of invariants $B_G$: $B_G$ is noetherian, $B_x$ is module-finite over it, and the contraction of $B_x$ to $K_0$ is generated as a subring by the constants from $k_0\cap A$ together with a finite set), `hAdom`, `hAdvr`, `hAcompl`, `hπhat` ($\widehat{A_0}$ is a complete discrete valuation domain with maximal ideal generated by $\pi_0$), `hnunit` ($n$ is a unit of $\widehat{A_0}$), `hmodelloc`, `hmodelcompl` (the crossing model $\mathrm{UVCrossingModel}\,\widehat{A_0}\,(\hat\pi_0^{\,m})$ is local and adically complete), `hsplit₁` and `hsplit₂` (existence of $G$-invariant splitting witnesses in the chart algebra, respectively in $\tilde{\mathcal O}$, separating $W_t$ from an auxiliary $W_x$), `hN3wit` (descent to $W_x\cap K_0$ of an Eisenstein-type parameter over $k_0$), `hN3laws` (for such $W_x$, descent to $K_0$ of the modular functions $g$ as above, with vanishing in $W_x\cap K_0$ equivalent to vanishing of the $R_0$-residue and with membership in $\mathcal O$ and congruence to the matching constants when that residue lies in the valuation subring of $s$), `hN4frac` (descent of the localisation presentation of $\tilde{\mathcal O}$ to fractions in $K_0$), `hjfix` ($G$ fixes $\mathrm{jqNModC}\,k_0\,q$), `hN5` (descent of the Igusa-type separating element from $B_x$ to $B_x\cap K_0$), and `hIGSEP` (descent of the separation of the remaining ends to the remaining members of $\mathrm{nodes}$).
--
--   **Conclusion.** Then $\mathcal O$ is contained in $W_0'$, and $\mathcal O$ is a local noetherian ring such that:
--
--   (i) for $x\in k_0$: $x\in A$ if and only if the image of $x$ in $K_0$ lies in $\mathcal O$;
--
--   (ii) every $f\in\mathcal O$ is congruent to a constant: there is $x\in k_0$ with $x\in A$ whose image lies in $\mathcal O$ and with $f-x$ not a unit of $\mathcal O$;
--
--   (iii) there exist $E_0\ge1$, an element $v\in k_0$ with $v\in A$ and $v^{-1}\in A$ and $\pi_0^{E_0}=\varpi_t^{\,2\cdot\mathrm{placeWidthChar}\,q\,M'\,s}\cdot v$, a witness that the image of $\pi_0$ lies in $\mathcal O$, elements $c_x,c_y\in\mathcal O$, a unit $u$ of $\mathcal O$, a ring isomorphism
--   $$\iota:\ \mathrm{AdicCompletion}(\mathfrak m_{\mathcal O})\,\mathcal O\ \xrightarrow{\ \sim\ }\ \mathrm{UVCrossingModel}\,\widehat{A_0}\,(\hat\pi_0^{\,E_0}),$$
--   and units $\gamma_U,\gamma_V$ of that model, such that:
--
--   • $c_xc_y=\pi_0^{E_0}\cdot u$ in $\mathcal O$;
--
--   • for every $x\in k_0\cap A$ whose image lies in $\mathcal O$, $\iota$ sends that image to $\mathrm{UVCrossingModel.const}$ of the image of $x$ in $\widehat{A_0}$;
--
--   • $\iota(c_x)=\gamma_U\cdot U(\hat\pi_0^{\,E_0})$ and $\iota(c_y)=\gamma_V\cdot V(\hat\pi_0^{\,E_0})$;
--
--   • $c_y$ lies in $W_0'$ and in its maximal ideal, while $c_x$, whenever it lies in $W_0'$, lies outside the maximal ideal of $W_0'$;
--
--   • the element $\mathrm{jqNModC}\,k_0\,q-a_0$ lies in $K_0$ and in $\mathcal O$, and there are $e\ge1$ and a unit $w_V$ of the model with $\iota$ of it equal to $w_V\cdot V(\hat\pi_0^{\,E_0})^e$;
--
--   • there is a valuation subring $W_x$ of $K_0$ such that: $\mathcal O\subseteq W_x$; for $x\in k_0$, $x\in A$ if and only if its image lies in $W_x$; $W_x$ is a discrete valuation ring whose maximal ideal is generated by the image of $\pi_0$; there is $t\in W_x$ such that for every $p\in k_0[X]$ with all coefficients in $A$, if $p(t)$ lies in the maximal ideal of $W_x$ then so does every coefficient of $p$; $c_x$ lies in the maximal ideal of $W_x$ and $c_y$ does not; for every $g\in\mathrm{modularFunctionFieldFull}\,M'$ whose base change to $\mathrm{modularFunctionFieldBar}\,M'$ lies in $R_0.\mathrm{integers}$ and has non-negative order at every place at which $\mathrm{jq}$ does, and whose image $\mathrm{coeffEmb}\,k_0\,g$ lies in $K_\ell$, that image lies in $K_0$ and in $W_x$, it lies in the maximal ideal of $W_x$ if and only if its $R_0$-residue is zero, and if that residue lies in the valuation subring of $s$ then the image lies in $\mathcal O$ and, for every $c\in k_0\cap A$ whose image lies in $\mathcal O$ and whose residue in $\mathrm{ResidueField}\,A$ equals $s.\mathrm{evalAt}$ of that residue, the difference of the two elements of $\mathcal O$ is not a unit; and for every $\mathcal O'\in\mathrm{nodes}$ with $\mathcal O'\ne\mathcal O$ there is $f\in\mathcal O'$ with $f\notin W_x$;
--
--   • there is a subring $B_x$ of $K_0$ such that: every $f\in B_x$ lies, as an element of $K_\ell$, in $B_0$, and lies in $\mathcal O$; for every $f\in B_x$ and every place $P$ of $K_\ell$ over $k_0$, $0\le P.\mathrm{ord}\,j_\ell$ implies $0\le P.\mathrm{ord}\,f$; $\mathcal O$ is the localisation of $B_x$, in the sense that $f\in\mathcal O$ if and only if $f\cdot h=g$ for some $g,h\in B_x$ with $h$ a unit of $\mathcal O$; every $f\in K_0$ satisfies $f\cdot h=g$ with $g,h\in B_x$, $h\ne0$; there is a finite set $T\subseteq K_0$ with $B_x$ the subring generated by $T$ together with the images of the elements of $k_0\cap A$; and there is $b\in B_x$ such that for every valuation subring $V$ of $K_0$ with the property that $x\in A$ if and only if the image of $x$ lies in $V$ (for $x\in k_0$), with the image of $\pi_0$ in the maximal ideal of $V$, and such that, the image of $\mathrm{coeffEmb}\,k_0\,\mathrm{jq}$ lying in $K_\ell$, in $K_0$ and in $V$, every monic $p\in k_0[X]$ with coefficients in $A$ has $p$ evaluated at it a unit of $V$, and such that some $f\in\mathcal O$ lies outside $V$, one has $b\notin V$.
--
--   This is the per-node step of the descent from the auxiliary rigid level to level $H_1$ in the construction of the semistable model of the modular curve at a supersingular point in characteristic $q$, here in the $\Gamma_1(\ell_g)$ 'diamond' frame at the small prime $q=3$: from a crossing presentation of one end $\tilde{\mathcal O}$ of the rigid model over the $\mathsf q$-adic crossing model $\widehat{A_0}[\![X_0,X_1]\!]/(X_0X_1-\pi_0^m)$ it produces the corresponding presentation, with exponent $E_0$, of the descended local ring $\mathcal O=\tilde{\mathcal O}\cap K_0$ at the node, together with the valuation-theoretic and chart data that identify the node with the supersingular place $s$ and separate it from the other nodes.

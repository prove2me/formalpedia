-- title:
--   The derivative of the Huber function is the clipping map
-- statement:
--   For $c \ge 0$, the derivative of the one-dimensional Huber function (20.2) is the clipping of the argument to $[-c,c]$:
--   $$\frac{d}{dx} H_c(x) = \operatorname{clamp}_{[-c,c]}(x) = \max\bigl(-c,\ \min(c, x)\bigr) \qquad (x \in \mathbb{R}),$$
--   where $H_c(x) = x^2/2$ for $|x| \le c$ and $H_c(x) = c|x| - c^2/2$ for $|x| \ge c$ is the Huber function and $\operatorname{clamp}_{[-c,c]}$ denotes projection onto the interval $[-c,c]$. This is the pointwise form of the source's claim at lines 1853-1858 that the Huber function has a globally $1$-Lipschitz gradient.

  Source: `auditable_full_proof_nag_and_five_algorithm_cn.md`, section 20
  (「定理 A 的 matching lower bound」, lines 1817-2046).

  The source fixes `L = 1`, `x⋆ = 0`, `x₀ = R > 0`, sets

      c = R / (2 d_N + 1)                                    (20.1)

  and defines the one-dimensional Huber function

      f x = x²/2            if |x| ≤ c
      f x = c |x| - c²/2    if |x| ≥ c                       (20.2)

  It then states (lines 1853-1858) that `f` is convex, differentiable, has a
  globally 1-Lipschitz gradient and has `0` as its unique minimizer, and proves
  the NAG trajectory identity

      x_j = R - d_j c                                        (20.3)

  together with the observation that the whole trajectory stays in the positive
  linear branch (`x_j ≥ c` for `j ≤ N`, source 20.2), whence

      (f(x_N) - f⋆) / R² = 2 / (N² + 7 N + 4)                (20.4)

  i.e. exactly `tau N` of `FullFormalization.Coefficients`.  This is the
  matching lower bound: the upper bound (19.1) is attained.

  ## Representation choices

  * The constant `c` is called `huberC` here: `d` is the coefficient sequence of
    `FullFormalization.Coefficients`, and `c` is used as a bound variable
    throughout the project, so a global `c` would be confusing.

  * `huber c : ℝ → ℝ` is stated for an arbitrary `c`; every property below
    carries the hypothesis `0 ≤ c` (or `0 < c`) that the source's `c`, being a
    quotient by the positive `2 d_N + 1`, always satisfies.

  * The gradient of `huber c` is the clipping `huberClamp c x = max (-c) (min c x)`
    of `x` to `[-c, c]`.  Its 1-Lipschitz property is `huberClamp_lipschitz`;
    it is monotone, which is how convexity of `huber c` is obtained (through
    `MonotoneOn.convexOn_of_deriv`).  Differentiability is proved by gluing the
    two branches at the kinks `±c`, where the one-sided derivatives agree.

  * **Index range of (20.3).**  The source writes `x_j = R - d_j c` for the
    iterates of the method.  The induction only ever queries `x_0, …, x_N`
    (the method stops at `x_N`), and it uses the branch hypothesis `x_j ≥ c`,
    which is *false* for `j > N`.  Accordingly `huber_traj` below is stated for
    `j ≤ N`, which is exactly the range on which (20.3) is true.  (For `N = 1`,
    `R = 1` one gets `c = 1/3`, `x_3 = -2/15` while `R - d_3 c = -1/4`: the
    unrestricted statement is false.)

the one-sided derivatives agree there (both are `±c`), so the gluing goes

-- title:
--   Courtade–Kumar proof module `GeneralCK.Certificates.E8QCoeff11 (part 2 of 3) (piece 1 of 2)` (transplant)
-- statement:
--   Verbatim transplant of the Lean module `GeneralCK.Certificates.E8QCoeff11 (part 2 of 3) (piece 1 of 2)` of the machine-checked proof of the general Courtade–Kumar theorem (the most informative Boolean function conjecture), so that the complete proof can be verified on this platform.
--
--   It is the original source with only two mechanical changes. Imports of project modules are redirected to their transplanted bundles `Definitions.Def_CK_*`. Declarations that already exist in earlier platform definition bundles of this mission are removed, and those bundles are imported instead, so every constant keeps a single platform identity.
--
--   The module contains both definitions and the lemmas proved alongside them in the source. They are kept together so the transplant stays faithful and every proof is re-checked by the server.

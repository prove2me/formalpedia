# Vertex Splitting: a formal model, and universal splitting constructions

Motivated by the paper *Hardness of Vertex Splitting: Cographs, Chordal Graphs, and Beyond*,
this file develops a formal, type-theoretic model of the **vertex splitting** operation on
simple graphs and proves structural results about it.

## The model

A single *vertex split* replaces a vertex `v` of a graph `G` by two nonadjacent vertices whose
neighbourhoods together cover `N(v)`.  Iterating splits, a graph `H` on a vertex type `W` is
obtainable from `G` on `V` exactly when there is a *splitting map* `f : W → V` such that

* `f` is surjective (no vertex disappears),
* every fibre `f⁻¹(u)` is an independent set of `H` (the copies of a vertex are nonadjacent),
* `f` maps edges of `H` to edges of `G` (no new adjacencies appear), and
* every edge of `G` is covered by an edge of `H` (the copies' neighbourhoods cover `N(u)`).

This is captured by `VertexSplitting.IsSplit`.  We justify the model by exhibiting the
one-step split explicitly (`VertexSplitting.singleSplit`, `VertexSplitting.isSplit_singleSplit`)
and showing that the relation is reflexive and transitive.

## Main results

* `VertexSplitting.IsSplit.comp`: splitting maps compose (splits can be iterated).
* `VertexSplitting.IsSplit.card_le`: splitting never decreases the number of vertices.
* `VertexSplitting.IsSplit.card_edgeFinset_le`: splitting never decreases the number of edges.
* `VertexSplitting.IsSplit.adj_iff_of_injective`: a splitting map that adds no vertex is an
  isomorphism, i.e. zero splits change nothing.
* `VertexSplitting.isSplit_singleSplit`: the explicit one-step split is a splitting map.
* `VertexSplitting.isSplit_matchingGraph`: splitting each vertex `v` into `deg v` copies turns
  any graph without isolated vertices into a perfect matching, using `2|E| - |V|` splits, and
  this splitting is *exclusive*.
* `VertexSplitting.isCograph_matchingGraph`, `isChordal_matchingGraph`,
  `hasUnitIntervalRep_matchingGraph`: the resulting graph is a cograph (`P₄`-free), chordal,
  and a unit interval graph.
* `VertexSplitting.isPtFree_matchingGraph`: the result is moreover `P_t`-free for every
  `t ≥ 3`, covering the whole `P_t`-free hierarchy considered in the paper.
* `VertexSplitting.two_mul_card_edgeFinset_le_of_split_matching`: `2|E| - |V|` splits are also
  *necessary* whenever the target has maximum degree at most one, so the construction is exact.
* `VertexSplitting.card_lt_of_split_cograph`, `card_lt_of_split_chordal`: a graph that is not
  already a cograph (resp. chordal) needs at least one split, since a splitting map that adds
  no vertex is an isomorphism.
* `VertexSplitting.exists_split_cograph_chordal_unitInterval`: the resulting universal upper
  bound `2|E| - |V|` on the splitting number for all these target classes.
* `VertexSplitting.exists_singleSplit_factor` and `VertexSplitting.SplitChain.of_isSplit`:
  every splitting map between finite graphs factors as a chain of explicit *single* splits,
  and the chain can always be taken **shallow** (a newly created vertex is never split again);
  if the splitting is exclusive (`IsProjExclusive`) then every single split in the chain is
  exclusive as well.
* `VertexSplitting.splitChain_matchingGraph`: in particular the universal `2|E| - |V|`
  splitting is realized by a shallow, exclusive chain of single splits.
* `VertexSplitting.not_hasInducedClaw_of_unitIntervalRep`: unit interval graphs are claw-free,
  whence `VertexSplitting.card_lt_of_split_unitInterval`: a graph with an induced claw needs
  at least one split to become a unit interval graph (`starK13` is an explicit witness).

The paper distinguishes general splittings from *shallow* ones (no newly created vertex is
split again) and from *exclusive* ones (the copies of a split vertex get disjoint
neighbourhoods).  In this section we show that the abstract model `IsSplit` loses nothing:
every splitting map factors as a chain of explicit single splits (`singleSplit`), and this
chain can always be chosen **shallow**; moreover if the splitting is exclusive (in the
projected sense below) then every single split in the chain is exclusive as well. -/

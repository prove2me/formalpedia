-- title:
--   Complements on Dedekind-domain factorization
-- statement:
--   Let $R$ be a Dedekind domain with fraction field $K$. Each nonzero prime determines an invertible fractional ideal. For nonzero fractional ideals $I,J$ and each nonzero prime $P$, the prime multiplicities satisfy
--
--   $$
--   v_P(I/J)=v_P(I)-v_P(J).
--   $$
--
--   These multiplicities have finite support. They connect fractional-ideal factorization with valuations.

# Complements on Dedekind-domain factorization

Facts about `Associates.count` and `FractionalIdeal.count` that Mathlib does not carry, together
with unit-level factorization of invertible fractional ideals.

## Main results

* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.le_count_associates_iff_le_pow`: the multiplicity of `v` in
  a nonzero `J` is at least `k` exactly when `v ^ k` contains `J`. The multiplicity here is
  `Associates.count`, not `FractionalIdeal.count` — hence the `associates` token, matching
  Mathlib's `Ideal.count_associates_factors_eq` for the same expression. Mathlib reads that
  multiplicity as divisibility of `Associates`; a consumer comparing two multiplicities across a
  ring extension wants a containment of *ideals*, and shows the two ideals contain the same prime
  powers.
* `FractionalIdeal.count_div`: the multiplicity of `I / J` is the difference of the multiplicities
  of `I` and `J`. Mathlib's `count` API has `count_mul`, `count_inv`, `count_pow` and `count_zpow`
  but no division form, so every consumer that clears a denominator repeats the same rewrites.
* `FractionalIdeal.count_spanSingleton_div`: the same on principal fractional ideals. This is the
  one the `S`-integer class-group computation in
  `TauCeti/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/SInteger/ClassGroup.lean` uses, at both `R` and `𝒪_S` — which
  is why the ring is a variable rather than fixed — advancing
  `TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md` §Layer 6 (Mordell–Weil), whose weak-Mordell–Weil
  argument needs the `S`-class group to be finite. It is also the step that carries
  `count_toPrincipalIdeal_eq_neg_log_valuation` below. `count_div` is its general form and has no
  consumer in this repository yet.
* `FractionalIdeal.count_toPrincipalIdeal_eq_neg_log_valuation`: the multiplicity at `v` of the
  principal fractional ideal of a nonzero rational function `u : Kˣ` is
  `-WithZero.log (v.valuation K u)`. This is the passage between the two ways this library measures
  a principal ideal at a height one prime — Mathlib's `count` and the adic valuation.
* `Ideal.hasFiniteMulSupport_asIdeal_pow_of_le_count`: a family of prime powers whose exponents
  are bounded by the multiplicities of a fixed nonzero ideal has finite multiplicative support.
  Mathlib's `Ideal.hasFiniteMulSupport` is the case of the multiplicities themselves; a consumer
  defining an ideal as `∏ᵥ 𝔭ᵥ ^ e v` for exponents it only knows to be dominated by an actual
  factorisation — as the minimal discriminant ideal of an elliptic curve is dominated by the
  discriminant of any integral model — needs the bounded form to see that the product is finite.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.unitOfPrime`: a height-one prime regarded as an invertible
  fractional ideal.
* `FractionalIdeal.hasFiniteMulSupport_zpow_count`: a family of powers indexed by the height one
  primes, with the multiplicities of a fixed fractional ideal as exponents, has finite
  multiplicative support. The bases are an arbitrary family in an arbitrary `DivInvMonoid`, since
  nothing but the vanishing of almost all exponents is at stake; the unit-level factorization below
  is the case of the primes themselves.
* `FractionalIdeal.finprod_unitOfPrime_zpow_count`: unique factorization of an invertible
  fractional ideal, transported along `Units.coeHom`.

All these declarations are general facts about an arbitrary Dedekind domain, mentioning no
particular ring extension.

`le_count_associates_iff_le_pow` is adapted from Michael Stoll's elliptic-curves formalisation
(`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves`, `EllipticCurves/Mathlib/Basic.lean:381` at the
roadmap's pin `66889eada51a`, Apache 2.0, by Michael Stoll); following this repository's convention
for adapted material, the upstream authorship is credited here rather than in the copyright header.
**`count_div` and `count_spanSingleton_div` are new here** — they have no counterpart in that
source. `count_toPrincipalIdeal_eq_neg_log_valuation` is this repository's own, relocated here
from `TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/WeilDivisor/Dedekind/Basic.lean`: nothing in its statement or
proof mentions a Weil divisor, and stating it under `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry` put it out of
reach of the `RingTheory` consumers that need it, which is exactly the boundary
`TauCeti/RingTheory/ClassGroup/HeightOneSpectrum.lean` records in its module docstring.

The unit-level prime factorization `FractionalIdeal.finprod_unitOfPrime_zpow_count` is adapted
from Michael Stoll's `EllipticCurves/Mathlib/FractionalIdeal.lean` at commit `66889eada51a` of the
`MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves` repository (Apache 2.0).

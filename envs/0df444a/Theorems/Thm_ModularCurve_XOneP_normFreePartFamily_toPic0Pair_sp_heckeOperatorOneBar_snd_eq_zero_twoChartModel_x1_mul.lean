-- title:
--   Triangularity of Uₚ on specialisations of the norm-free part
-- statement:
--   Throughout, $p$ is a prime, $M$ a positive integer with $5 \le M$ (`hM`) and $p \nmid M$ (`hpM`), $Pl$ is a valuation subring of an algebraic closure $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ of $\mathbb{Q}$, and $\kappa :=$ `IsLocalRing.ResidueField ↥Pl` is assumed algebraically closed, of characteristic $p$, and an $A$-algebra. Here $L$ is a field of characteristic zero which is a cyclotomic extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ of type $\{p\}$, $\zeta \in L$ a primitive $p$-th root of unity, $K$ an intermediate field of $L \subseteq \mathrm{LaurentSeries}\,L$ with $K =$ [`ModularCurve.laurentBaseChange L (ModularCurve.x1FunctionField (M * p))`](def/ModularCurve_LaurentCoeff.html#L103) (`hK`), that is, the function field of $X_1(Mp)$ read through $q$-expansions and base changed to $L$; $A$ is a discrete valuation ring, a domain with fraction field $L$, such that $p$ lies in its maximal ideal (`hAp`) and $\zeta$ lies in the image of $A$ (`hζA`), with $K$ an $A$-algebra compatibly with $A \to L \to K$; and $j \in K$ is a nonzero element whose Laurent expansion is the image of the $q$-expansion [`ModularCurve.jq`](def/ModularCurve_X0.html#L157) of the modular invariant (`hj`). The two-chart model [`ModularCurve.TwoChart.modelTo A (↥K) j`](def/ModularCurve_TwoChartModel.html#L252) over $\operatorname{Spec} A$ (the pushout of the two affine charts $\operatorname{Spec}$ of the integral closures `chartAlgFin`, `chartAlgInf` of $A[j]$, $A[j^{-1}]$ in $K$) is assumed proper.
--
--   The geometric special fibre is described by two curves: $C_1, C_2$ are schemes with structure morphisms $c_1, c_2$ to $\operatorname{Spec}\kappa$, each proper, smooth of relative dimension $1$ and geometrically integral, together with closed immersions $i_1, i_2$ of $C_1, C_2$ over $\kappa$ into the base change of the two-chart model to $\kappa$; `hcover` says every point of that base change lies in the image of $i_1$ or of $i_2$, `hred` that the scheme-theoretic intersection `pullback i₁.1 i₂.1` is reduced, and $n$ is its number of points (`hn`), assumed positive (`hn0`). Sections are fixed: $\varepsilon$ of the two-chart model over $\operatorname{Spec} A$, and $\varepsilon_1, \varepsilon_2$ of $c_1, c_2$, with $\varepsilon_1$ followed by $i_1$ equal to the base change of $\varepsilon$ to $\kappa$ (`hε₁`).
--
--   The relative Picard data consist of: a designation $D$ (a scheme $D.P$ over $\operatorname{Spec} A$ with a zero section) for the relative $\mathrm{Pic}^0$ of the two-chart model, a representability witness `hrep` for the condition `algEquivZeroCut` (fibrewise algebraic equivalence to zero of rigidified line bundles), with $D.toBase$ smooth (`hsm`) and separated (`hsep`); the corresponding witness `hreps` over $\kappa$ for `D.baseChange`, and `hPk` identifying its Poincaré bundle with the base change of the Poincaré bundle of `hrep.some`; designations $D_1, D_2$ over $\kappa$ for $c_1, c_2$ with witnesses `hrep₁`, `hrep₂`; and a morphism $\nu_2$ from $(D.\mathrm{baseChange}\,\kappa).toBase$ to $D_2.toBase$ over $\kappa$ whose compatibility `hν₂` states that, for every $\kappa$-scheme $T$ and every $T$-point $a$ of $(D.\mathrm{baseChange}\,\kappa).toBase$, the pullback of the Poincaré bundle of `hrep₂.some` along $a$ followed by $\nu_2$ is isomorphic to the rigidification along the $\varepsilon_2$-section of the restriction along $i_2$ of the pullback of the Poincaré bundle of `hreps` along $a$. Furthermore $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ is an $A$- and $L$-algebra compatibly, the base change of the two-chart model to $L$ is smooth of relative dimension $1$ (`hsmL`) and geometrically integral (`hgiL`), and the base change of $D.toBase$ to $L$ is proper (`hprL`) and geometrically connected (`hgcL`).
--
--   On the geometric side, $M\eta$ is a curve model over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ of the function field [`ModularCurve.x1FunctionFieldBar (M * p)`](def/ModularCurve_X1.html#L182) (an integral proper smooth curve with a prescribed isomorphism of its function field and a bijection of its closed points with the places), $e\eta$ an isomorphism of $M\eta.C$ with the geometric fibre of the two-chart model, compatible with the structure morphisms (`heη`); `hMηpin` pins down the $q$-expansions: for each element $a$ of `chartAlgFin A (↥K) j`, the element of `x1FunctionFieldBar (M * p)` obtained by taking the germ of $a$ at the generic point through the finite chart and transporting by $M\eta$'s function-field isomorphism has Laurent expansion the image of the Laurent expansion of $a$ under the coefficientwise map along $L \to \overline{\mathbb{Q}}$; `hgal` states that for every automorphism $g$ of $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ fixing $L$ pointwise, the bijection between $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-points of $M\eta.C$ and places is equivariant for the arithmetic Galois action [`ModularCurve.arithmeticGalois`](def/ModularCurve_ArithmeticGalois.html#L54). The Hecke inputs `hin` (`HeckeDiamondInputsAll (M * p)`) and the commutation `hcomm` (`HeckeDiamondCommuteBar (M * p)`) are assumed, as is a multiplicative semiring action of $\mathrm{Gal}(L/\mathbb{Q})$ on $A$ compatible with $A \to L$ (`hΓA`).
--
--   The abstract special fibre is a datum $G$ of type [`ModularCurve.JOneP.NeronSpecialFibreGeom p`](def/ModularCurve_JOnePGeom.html#L9): abelian groups $G.J0s$, $G.JI$, $G.JE$, a subgroup $G.\mathrm{torus}$ of $G.J0s$, and a surjection $G.\mathrm{proj} : G.J0s \to G.JI \times G.JE$ with kernel $G.\mathrm{torus}$. Bijections `pts`, `ptsI`, `ptsE` identify $G.J0s$, $G.JI$, $G.JE$ with the $\kappa$-points of $(D.\mathrm{baseChange}\,\kappa).toBase$, $D_1.toBase$, $D_2.toBase$; `hadd`, `haddI`, `haddE` require these identifications to turn addition into the tensor product of the pulled-back Poincaré bundles; `hproj` says that the two components of $G.\mathrm{proj}\,x$ correspond to the postcompositions of `pts x` with the pullback homomorphism along $i_1$ and with $\nu_2$ respectively; `hPTS` says that `pts` is additive and sends $0$ to the identity for the relative group law of `hreps`.
--
--   The arithmetic points and operators are: a bijection `gpts` from [`ModularCurve.JOne (M * p)`](def/ModularCurve_X1.html#L186) ($= \mathrm{Pic}^0$ of `x1FunctionFieldBar (M * p)` over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$) to the $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-points of $D.toBase$; a map $\varphi$ from the Hecke algebra [`ModularCurve.HeckeAlgOne`](def/ModularCurve_X1HeckeModule.html#L16) to endomorphisms of $D.toBase$ over $\operatorname{Spec} A$; and for each $s \in \mathrm{Gal}(L/\mathbb{Q})$ a morphism $\tau(s)$ of $D.P$ lying over the twist of $\operatorname{Spec} A$ by $s$. The hypotheses `hφmul` (each $\varphi(t)$ is a homomorphism for the relative group law of `hrep.some`), `hφpts` (`gpts` intertwines the Hecke module structure `heckeModuleOneBar` with postcomposition by $\varphi$), `hτ1`, `hτmul` ($\tau$ is multiplicative for composition, $\tau(1)$ the identity), `hτφ` ($\tau(s)$ and $\varphi(t)$ commute), `hgadd` (`gpts` is additive) and `hτpts` (for $\sigma'$ on $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ restricting to $s$ on $L$, `gpts (σ' • x)` is $\operatorname{Spec}$ of $\sigma'$ followed by `gpts x` followed by $\tau(s^{-1})$) fix their behaviour.
--
--   The Abel–Jacobi data comprise a representability witness `hDL` over $L$, a morphism `ajL` from the base change of the curve to $L$ to $(D.\mathrm{baseChange}\,L).toBase$, a comparison morphism `kL` between the geometric and the $L$-fibre (`hkL₁`, `hkL₂`), a morphism `ajbar` from $M\eta.C$ to $D.P$ defined as $e\eta$ followed by `kL`, `ajL` and the first projection (`hajbar`), lying over the structure morphisms (`hajbar_over`), and a $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-point $\bar\varepsilon$ of $M\eta.C$; `hPL` identifies the Poincaré bundle over $L$ with the base change of that of `hrep.some`, `hajLε` says `ajL` carries the section to the zero section, and `hajL` is the defining property of `ajL`: for every field $K'$ and every $K'$-point $x$ of the curve over $L$, the Poincaré bundle pulled back along $x$ followed by `ajL` is the line bundle of the relative effective Cartier divisor of $x$ tensored with the ideal module of the divisor of the $\varepsilon$-section. Further, `hεbar` and `hεbar_aj` say $\bar\varepsilon$ is the point induced by $\varepsilon$ and is carried to the zero section, and `hpts_aj` says that for all $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-points $x$ and $s$ of $M\eta.C$ with $s$ induced by $\varepsilon$, there is a degree-zero divisor $Dv$ equal to the place of $x$ minus the place of $s$ with `gpts (Pic0.mk Dv)` equal to $x$ followed by `ajbar`.
--
--   The operator datum $O$ of type [`ModularCurve.JOneP.NeronSpecialFibreOpsV3 G`](def/ModularCurve_JOnePOpsV3.html#L13) (Hecke operators on $G.J0s$, $G.JI$, $G.JE$, diamond operators `diamondP`, `diamondN`, the involution `w`, an inertia action, and the auxiliary maps `verI`, `frobE`, `diamondNI`, together with their commutation axioms) is tied to $\varphi$ and $\tau$ by `hO`, a conjunction of four clauses: for every prime $\ell$ the action of $O.\mathrm{hecke}\,\ell$ on $\kappa$-points corresponds to $\varphi(\mathrm{heckeGenOne}\,\ell)$; for $b \in (\mathbb{Z}/p)^\times$ and $d$ coprime to $Mp$ with $d \equiv 1 \bmod M$ and $d \equiv b \bmod p$, $O.\mathrm{diamondP}\,b$ corresponds to $\varphi(\mathrm{diamondGen}\,d)$; for $d$ coprime to $Mp$ with $d \equiv 1 \bmod p$, $O.\mathrm{diamondN}\,d$ corresponds to $\varphi(\mathrm{diamondGen}\,d)$; and for $b \in (\mathbb{Z}/p)^\times$ and $s \in \mathrm{Gal}(L/\mathbb{Q})$ with $s\zeta = \zeta^{b}$, $O.\mathrm{inertia}\,b$ corresponds to $\tau(s)$.
--
--   The local data at $Pl$ are: `hPl`, that $p$ is a nonunit of $Pl$; a ring homomorphism $\rho : A \to Pl$ with $hρ$ saying it lifts $A \to \overline{\mathbb{Q}}$; and `hAlgκ`, that $A \to \kappa$ is $\rho$ followed by the residue map. The hypothesis `hF3` is the integral-points package: for every subgroup $I$ of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})$ contained in the inertia subgroup of $Pl$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, fixing all $p$-th roots of unity, and of finite index in that inertia subgroup, writing $\mathcal{O}_I := Pl \cap \overline{\mathbb{Q}}^{I}$, there is a lift $\rho_I : A \to \mathcal{O}_I$ of $A \to \overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ such that, with $\mathrm{dom}$ the set of $x \in$ `JOne (M * p)` for which `gpts x` factors through $\operatorname{Spec}\mathcal{O}_I$, five clauses hold: points of $\mathrm{dom}$ are fixed by $I$; the factorisation through $\operatorname{Spec}\mathcal{O}_I$ is unique; $\mathrm{dom}$ contains $0$ and is closed under subtraction; for every $n > 0$ with $p \nmid n$, an $n$-torsion $\mathcal{O}_I$-point reducing to the identity $\kappa$-point is the identity, and every $n$-torsion $\kappa$-point lifts to an $n$-torsion $\mathcal{O}_I$-point; and $\mathrm{dom}$ is stable under any Frobenius element at $Pl$ for $p$ normalising $I$.
--
--   Next, $\mathcal{A}$ is a scheme with structure morphism $a$ to $\operatorname{Spec} A$ and a morphism $\iota$ into $D.toBase$ over $A$, and `h𝒜` is a conjunction of six clauses: $\iota$ is a closed immersion; $a$ is proper and smooth with connected geometric fibres over algebraically closed fields; the points of $\mathcal{A}$ are closed under the identity, the multiplication and the inversion of the relative group law of `hrep.some`; a point $x$ of `JOne (M * p)` lies in [`ModularCurve.normFreePartAt (M * p) p`](def/ModularCurve_X1PrimitiveSpecializationAtP.html#L29) (the image of the endomorphism `normFreeEnd` attached to the representatives `normFreeRepsAt` at $p$) if and only if `gpts x` factors through $\mathcal{A}$; and the points of $\mathcal{A}$ are stable under postcomposition with every $\varphi(t)$. The hypothesis `hF10` states that for every $\kappa$-algebra $T'$ and every $T'$-point $v$ of $(D.\mathrm{baseChange}\,\kappa).toBase$ which lifts to a $T'$-point of $\mathcal{A}$, the composition of $v$ with $\varphi$ of the sum over $b \in (\mathbb{Z}/p)^\times$ of $\mathrm{diamondGen}$ at the Chinese-remainder lift of $(b,1)$ modulo $Mp$ is the identity point.
--
--   The Igusa description of the two components consists of: an integral weight one form $w$ of level $M$ over $\kappa$ (a modular form of weight $1$ on $\Gamma_1(M)$ with an integral $q$-expansion whose reduction is nonzero), curve models $\mathrm{Mdl}_1, \mathrm{Mdl}_2$ over $\kappa$ of the Igusa function field [`ModularCurve.igusaFunctionFieldX1C κ M w`](def/ModularCurve_IgusaFunctionFieldX1.html#L35) (the function field of $X_1(M)$ over $\kappa$ adjoined the inverse of the reduced $q$-expansion of $w$), with isomorphisms $e_1 : \mathrm{Mdl}_1.C \cong C_1$, $e_2 : \mathrm{Mdl}_2.C \cong C_2$ over $\kappa$ (`he₁`, `he₂`); the Gauss-type reading `hgauss₁` of $q$-expansions on $C_1$: for $a$ in the finite chart algebra and power series $x, y$ over $A$ with $y$ reducing to a nonzero series, if the Laurent expansion of $a$ times the image of $y$ equals the image of $x$ over $L$, then the germ of $a$ at the generic point of $\mathrm{Mdl}_1.C$, read in the Igusa function field, has Laurent expansion the quotient of the reductions of $x$ and $y$; the hypothesis `hεC₂` that the $\kappa$-section induced by $\varepsilon$ never meets the image of $i_2$; the Galois equivariance `hεgal` of $\varepsilon$ for every endomorphism of the two-chart model lying over the twist of $\operatorname{Spec} A$ by $s \in \mathrm{Gal}(L/\mathbb{Q})$ and induced on the finite chart by a ring automorphism acting on Laurent coefficients through $s$; a finite set $\mathrm{nodesIg}$ of pairs of places of the Igusa function field; isomorphisms $\Psi : G.J0s \cong \mathrm{GluedPic}^0(\kappa, \text{Igusa}, \mathrm{nodesIg})$ (the quotient of admissible gluing data — pairs of degree-zero divisors vanishing at the node places, together with a family of units indexed by the nodes — by the glued principal subgroup), and $\theta_1, \theta_2$ from $G.JI$, $G.JE$ onto $\mathrm{Pic}^0$ of the Igusa function field; and the hypothesis `hF4c`, a conjunction of seven clauses: $\mathrm{nodesIg}$ is exactly the set of pairs of places coming from $\kappa$-points of `pullback i₁.1 i₂.1` via $\mathrm{Mdl}_1$, $\mathrm{Mdl}_2$; its cardinality is $n$; both projections are injective on it; $\Psi$ is compatible with `toPic0Pair` and $(\theta_1, \theta_2) \circ G.\mathrm{proj}$; the image of $G.\mathrm{torus}$ under $\Psi$ is the range of `GluedPic0.nodeUnit`; and $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$ are given by the Abel–Jacobi recipe, the class of the place of $x$ minus the place of $\varepsilon_1$, resp. of $\varepsilon_2$, whenever the corresponding Poincaré pullback is the line bundle of $x$ tensor the ideal module of the section. Finally $\mathrm{frobT}$ is a semilinear automorphism of the Igusa function field over $\kappa$ acting on Laurent coefficients by $c \mapsto c^{p}$ (`hfrobT`).
--
--   The specialisation family is abstract: for each subgroup $I$ as in `hF3` (contained in the inertia subgroup at $Pl$, trivial on $\mu_p$, of finite index there) a subgroup $\mathrm{dom}\mathcal{D}(I)$ of `JOne (M * p)` and an additive map $\mathrm{sp}\mathcal{D}(I)$ from it to $\mathrm{GluedPic}^0$ are given, subject to the interface `hIFm`: $y$ lies in $\mathrm{dom}\mathcal{D}(I)$ if and only if `gpts y` factors through $\operatorname{Spec}\mathcal{O}_I$ (for the lift chosen from `hF3`), and $\mathrm{sp}\mathcal{D}(I)\,y = \Psi(\mathrm{pts}^{-1}u)$ for every $\kappa$-point $u$ which is the reduction of such a factorisation; and subject to `hlev`, the conjunction of a push-out clause (for $J \le I$ both admissible, any $\mathcal{O}_I$-point representing $y$ extends to an $\mathcal{O}_J$-point with the same reduction, again representing $y$) and a level-independence clause ($y \in \mathrm{dom}\mathcal{D}(I)$ implies $y \in \mathrm{dom}\mathcal{D}(J)$ with the same specialisation).
--
--   Under all of this, the conclusion is the following single assertion. For all subgroups $I$ and $I'$ of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})$, each contained in the inertia subgroup of $Pl$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, each fixing every $\zeta$ with $\zeta^{p} = 1$, and each of finite index in that inertia subgroup, and for every $y \in$ [`ModularCurve.normFreePartAt (M * p) p`](def/ModularCurve_X1PrimitiveSpecializationAtP.html#L29) with $y \in \mathrm{dom}\mathcal{D}(I)$ and with [`ModularCurve.heckeOperatorOneBar (M * p) ⟨p, _⟩ y`](def/ModularCurve_X1HeckeModule.html#L36) $\in \mathrm{dom}\mathcal{D}(I')$: if the second component of [`AlgebraicCurve.GluedPic0.toPic0Pair`](def/AlgebraicCurve_GluedPic0.html#L229) applied to $\mathrm{sp}\mathcal{D}(I)\,y$ vanishes, then the second component of `toPic0Pair` applied to $\mathrm{sp}\mathcal{D}(I')$ of $U_p y$ vanishes as well, where $U_p$ denotes `heckeOperatorOneBar (M * p)` at the prime $p$.
--
--   This is the triangularity of $U_p$ on the special fibre of the Néron model of $J_1(Mp)$ at $p$, in the form needed for level lowering: the Hecke operator at $p$ preserves the condition that the specialisation of a norm-free point have vanishing component in the $\mathrm{Pic}^0$ of the second Igusa copy, the one not met by the reduction of the cusp. It is stated over the full assembly frame for $X_1(Mp)$ and an abstract specialisation family indexed by finite-index subgroups of inertia, and feeds the family statement [`ModularCurve.exists_qExpSemistableSpecializationPinnedV3_family_normFreePart_and_diamond_of_dvd_of_not_sq_dvd_of_le_div`](thm.html#ModularCurve.exists_qExpSemistableSpecializationPinnedV3_family_normFreePart_and_diamond_of_dvd_of_not_sq_dvd_of_le_div).

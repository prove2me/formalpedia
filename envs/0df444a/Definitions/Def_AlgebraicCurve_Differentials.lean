-- title:
--   Order of a differential at a place; regular differentials
-- statement:
--   The module works over a field extension $K \subseteq F$ and takes the differentials of $F/K$ to be Mathlib's module of Kähler differentials $\Omega[F\!\mid\!K]$ with its universal derivation $D =$ `KaehlerDifferential.D K F`; the places of $F/K$ and their $\mathbb{Z}$-valued order function `Place.ord` (normalised so that an irreducible element of the valuation ring has order $1$, and with $\operatorname{ord} 0 = 0$) are those of the divisor-class-group module. Four total, choice-based definitions are made. For a place $v$, `Place.uniformizer_alt` is a chosen $t \in F$ with $v.\mathrm{ord}\,t = 1$ when such a $t$ exists and $0$ otherwise; `ord_uniformizer_alt` records that under the hypothesis that some element of order $1$ exists, the chosen element has order $1$. For $t \in F$ and $\omega \in \Omega[F\!\mid\!K]$, `Place.diffCoeff t ω` is a chosen $g \in F$ with $\omega = g \cdot D t$ when $\omega$ lies in the $F$-line through $D t$, and $0$ otherwise; `diffCoeff_smul_D` and `diffCoeff_of_not_exists` are the two defining cases. The order of $\omega$ at $v$ is then $v.\mathrm{ordDiff}\,\omega = v.\mathrm{ord}\big(\mathrm{diffCoeff}\ v.\mathrm{uniformizer\_alt}\ \omega\big)$, a total $\mathbb{Z}$-valued quantity which takes the default value $0$ in the degenerate cases; accordingly the existence of a uniformizer, the uniqueness of the coefficient $g$ and the independence of `ordDiff` of the chosen uniformizer are assertions external to these definitions. A differential is regular, `IsRegularDiff K F ω`, when $0 \le v.\mathrm{ordDiff}\,\omega$ for every place $v$, and `regularDiffs K F` is defined as the $K$-span of the set of regular differentials, a $K$-submodule of $\Omega[F\!\mid\!K]$ containing every regular differential. Finally, for a $K$-algebra map $\varphi : F \to F'$ into a second field, `pullbackDiff φ` is the $K$-linear map $\Omega[F\!\mid\!K] \to \Omega[F'\!\mid\!K]$ coming from `KaehlerDifferential.map` for the $F$-algebra structure on $F'$ given by $\varphi$; it sends $D_{F/K}x$ to $D_{F'/K}(\varphi x)$.
--
--   **Relation to Mathlib.** The carrier and universal derivation are Mathlib's `KaehlerDifferential` module $\Omega[F⁄K]$, and `pullbackDiff` is `KaehlerDifferential.map` for the algebra structure induced by a $K$-algebra map, restricted to $K$-scalars. The order of a differential at a place, the predicate of regularity and the submodule of regular differentials are the project's own notions, built on the places and order function of the project's divisor module.
--
--   **Where it is used.** These notions belong to the project's self-contained divisor and differential theory of function fields, alongside places, divisors, the degree map and the torsion of $\mathrm{Pic}^0$; the regular differentials and the order function at a place are the objects over which the genus-type statements used in the curve-theoretic part of the development are formulated.

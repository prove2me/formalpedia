# The stars of the Berggren tree: hypercycle pencils in the Poincaré half-plane

This file explains, and proves exactly, the *visual* structure of the Berggren tree of
primitive Pythagorean triples embedded in the Poincaré upper half-plane `ℍ` by the Euclid
seed map

  `z(m, n) = (n + i) / m`,

namely the **families of straight lines that emanate from rational boundary points** and
which dominate any picture of the embedded tree.

## The phenomenon

Fix a boundary point `p/q ∈ ℚ ⊆ ∂ℍ` and an integer `k`. The seeds `(m, n)` with
`q * n - p * m = k` satisfy `Re z = p/q + (k/q) * Im z`, so they all lie on one Euclidean
half-line emanating from `p/q`. Such a Euclidean ray is *not* a geodesic: it is a
**hypercycle**, the curve of points at constant hyperbolic distance from the vertical
geodesic `(p/q, ∞)`. The main theorem `distVLine_hpoint` computes that distance exactly:

  `d_ℍ(z(m,n), geodesic at p/q) = arsinh (|q n - p m| / q)`.

So the picture is a superposition of *stars*: over each rational boundary point `p/q` sits
a discrete pencil of hypercycles indexed by `k ∈ ℤ`, at the quantized distances
`arsinh (|k| / q)`.

## Main results

* `isLeast_dist_vline`, `distVLine_eq` : for any `z ∈ ℍ` and any `a ∈ ℝ`, the distance from
  `z` to the complete geodesic `{Re = a}` is attained and equals `arsinh (|Re z - a| / Im z)`
  (a general half-plane fact, proved from `UpperHalfPlane.cosh_dist'`).
* `distVLine_hpoint` : the star formula above; `spoke_dist`, `costar_dist` : its two
  arithmetically meaningful specialisations, `arsinh n` at the boundary point `0` and
  `arsinh (m - n)` at the boundary point `1`.
* `charge_e1_eq`, `charge_e2_eq` : the two conserved *Lorentzian charges* of the Berggren
  action, `⟨v, e₁⟩ = -2n²` and `⟨v, e₂⟩ = -(m-n)²`, are exactly `-2 sinh²` and `-sinh²` of
  these two hyperbolic distances. The arithmetic invariants *are* geometric ones.
* `seedR_preserves_spoke`, `seedL_preserves_costar` : the Berggren move `B₃` slides a node
  along its `0`-hypercycle and `B₁` slides it along its `1`-hypercycle — each generator
  preserves one star exactly.
* `seedM_pell_flip`, `seedM_sinh_relation` : the third move `B₂` preserves no line of either
  star but negates the Pell form `m² - 2mn - n² = sinh²d₁ - 2 sinh²d₀`; this is the exact
  hyperbolic meaning of the Pell boundary layer.
* `spoke_tendsto_zero`, `costar_tendsto_one` : iterating `B₃` (resp. `B₁`) drives the node to
  the boundary point `0` (resp. `1`) *along* its hypercycle — the rays really do radiate out
  of the edge of the half-plane.
* `spoke_realized_iff` : an **exact census of the star**. The spoke index `n` occurs inside
  the hyperbolic ball `B(i, R)` if and only if `(n² + n + 1)/(n + 1) ≤ cosh R`; consequently
  the set of realized spoke indices is the initial interval `[1, K]` with
  `cosh R - 1 ≤ K < cosh R` (`spoke_realized_of_le`, `lt_cosh_of_spoke_realized`), so the
  number of visible rays in a ball of radius `R` is `Θ(e^R)`.
* `factoring_star_search_cost` : the cryptographic consequence. For odd `N` with two
  primitive representations, the nodes carrying `N` live in a ball of radius
  `R = ½ log N + log 2`, and the number of distinct hypercycles of the `0`-star meeting that
  ball is at least `√N / 2 - 1`: organising the collision search by star index costs `Θ(√N)`,
  the same as the naive enumeration.
* `dist_ge_spoke_gap` : colliding nodes, though at almost equal radius, are separated by at
  least the difference of their `arsinh` spoke indices, which is typically `≍ ½ log N`.

All of this is proved for Mathlib's genuine hyperbolic metric on `UpperHalfPlane`.

/-! ## Part 1. The exact distance from a point to a vertical geodesic

The complete geodesics of `ℍ` with one endpoint at `∞` are the vertical lines `{Re = a}`.
We compute the distance from an arbitrary point to such a line, exactly, and show the
infimum is attained (at the *foot* of the perpendicular). -/

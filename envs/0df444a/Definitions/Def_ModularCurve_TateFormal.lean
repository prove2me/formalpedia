-- title:
--   Formal Tate curve over ℤ⟦q⟧ and over K((q))
-- statement:
--   The module sets up the Tate Weierstrass model as a purely formal object. For a natural number $d$, `tateB d` is the integer quotient $(5d^3+7d^5)/12$, and `twelve_mul_tateB` records that the division is exact: $12\cdot\mathtt{tateB}\,d = 5d^3+7d^5$ for every $d$ (proved by a case analysis over residues modulo $12$). The two nonzero coefficients are power series over $\mathbb{Z}$: `tateA4` has $n$-th coefficient $-\sum_{d\mid n}5d^3 = -5\sigma_3(n)$ and `tateA6` has $n$-th coefficient $-\sum_{d\mid n}\mathtt{tateB}\,d$, i.e. $-(5\sigma_3(n)+7\sigma_5(n))/12$, the division by $12$ being carried out divisor by divisor inside $\mathbb{Z}$. Since $0$ has no divisors, both constant coefficients vanish; the coefficient lemmas also give $-5$ and $-1$ in degree $1$. Alongside these, `eisenstein6` is the power series with constant coefficient $1$ and $n$-th coefficient $-504\sigma_5(n)$ for $n\ge 1$. The curve `tatePowerSeries` is the Mathlib `WeierstrassCurve` over $\mathbb{Z}\llbracket q\rrbracket$ with $(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_6)=(1,0,0,\mathtt{tateA4},\mathtt{tateA6})$, that is $y^2+xy=x^3+a_4x+a_6$, and simp lemmas expose its coefficients. For a commutative ring $K$, `laurentOfInt K` is the ring homomorphism $\mathbb{Z}\llbracket q\rrbracket \to K((q))$ obtained by reducing coefficients along $\mathbb{Z}\to K$ and viewing the result as a Laurent series, and `tateLaurent K` is the base change of `tatePowerSeries` along it. The instance `instIsElliptic_tateLaurent` asserts that `tateLaurent K` is elliptic in Mathlib's sense, the discriminant being a unit; it is obtained from $\Delta$ having constant coefficient $0$ and coefficient $1$ in degree $1$, so that $\Delta = q\cdot(\text{unit})$ and $q$ is invertible in $K((q))$.
--
--   **Relation to Mathlib.** Mathlib's `WeierstrassCurve`, its base change along a ring homomorphism, its discriminant and the predicate `IsElliptic` (discriminant a unit) are used as given; the Tate model itself, its integral coefficient series and the homomorphism $\mathbb{Z}\llbracket q\rrbracket \to K((q))$ are the project's own definitions.
--
--   **Where it is used.** The model is formal throughout: nothing is evaluated at a value of $q$, and no uniformisation, point or torsion structure is introduced here. It supplies the integral Weierstrass model over $\mathbb{Z}\llbracket q\rrbracket$, specialising to every coefficient ring including residue characteristics $2$ and $3$, against which the $q$-expansion vocabulary of the modular-curve development (`eisenstein4`, `jNum`, `jq`) is later compared.

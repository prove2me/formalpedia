# Bridges are *not* an obstruction in the infinite setting

For finite cubic graphs, a bridge kills all three conjectures: the bridge is a one-element odd
cut, and `not_bergeFulkerson_of_oddCut_singleton` shows the same in the infinite setting
*provided one side of the cut is finite*.  This file shows that the finiteness proviso is
essential, by exhibiting

  `k4Chain` : an infinite cubic graph, every level of which is a copy of `K₄` with one edge
  "unrolled" along ℤ,

which

* is cubic (`k4Chain_isCubic`),
* satisfies Berge–Fulkerson, Fan–Raspaud and Máčajová–Škoviera
  (`k4Chain_bergeFulkerson`, …), and yet
* **has a bridge** (`k4Chain_isBridge`): in fact every edge joining level `m` to level `m+1`
  is one, so it has infinitely many bridges (`k4Chain_bridges_infinite`).

Hence, unlike in the finite case, bridgelessness is not a necessary condition for any of the
three properties once the graph is infinite: the two sides of the offending cut are infinite,
so the parity argument behind the finite obstruction has nothing to bite on.

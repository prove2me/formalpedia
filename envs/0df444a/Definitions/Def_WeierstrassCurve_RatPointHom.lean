-- title:
--   Affine Weierstrass points: functoriality along a field homomorphism
-- statement:
--   Throughout, $F$ and $k$ are fields, $f : F \to k$ is a ring homomorphism and $W_0$ is a Weierstrass curve over $F$; $W_0.map\ f$ denotes the Weierstrass curve over $k$ obtained by applying $f$ to the coefficients. The underlying map is [`WeierstrassCurve.ratPointMap`](../def/WeierstrassCurve_RatPointMap_probe.html#L16), defined by cases on an affine point of $W_0$: the point at infinity goes to the point at infinity, and an affine point $(x,y)$ together with a proof that it is nonsingular on $W_0$ goes to $(f(x),f(y))$, the nonsingularity being transported along $f$ by `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.map_nonsingular` applied to the injectivity of a ring homomorphism of fields. This module records the basic properties of that map and packages it as a homomorphism. `ratPointMap_zero` and `ratPointMap_some` are the two defining equations. `Affine.Point.some_congr` is a congruence lemma: two affine points `Point.some x₁ y₁ h₁` and `Point.some x₂ y₂ h₂` on a Weierstrass curve over $k$ are equal as soon as $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 = y_2$, irrespective of the nonsingularity proofs carried. `ratPointMap_injective` asserts injectivity of `ratPointMap f`, by the injectivity of $f$. `ratPointMap_add`, stated with decidable equality on $F$ and on $k$ so that Mathlib's addition of affine points is available, asserts $f_*(P+Q) = f_*P + f_*Q$ for all affine points $P,Q$ of $W_0$; the proof is the expected case analysis, splitting on whether $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 = -Y(x_2,y_2)$, and using the compatibility of $f$ with `negY`, with the slope and with the addition formulae for the $x$- and $y$-coordinates. Finally `ratPointHom` bundles `ratPointMap f` as an additive monoid homomorphism $W_0(F)^{\mathrm{aff}} \to (W_0.map\ f)(k)^{\mathrm{aff}}$ between the groups of affine points.

--   **Relation to Mathlib.** The transport of nonsingularity along $f$ and the compatibility of $f$ with `negY`, the slope and the addition formulae are Mathlib results (`Affine.map_nonsingular`, `Affine.map_negY`, `Affine.map_slope`, `Affine.map_addX`, `Affine.map_addY`); what is added here is the packaging of the coordinatewise map as an injective additive group homomorphism under the project's names `ratPointMap` and `ratPointHom`.
--
--   **Where it is used.** This is the base-change map on points used in setting up the Galois-theoretic side of the argument, for instance the inclusion $E(\mathbb{Q}) \hookrightarrow E(\overline{\mathbb{Q}})$ obtained by taking $f$ to be the structure map of an algebraic closure, so that rational points may be compared with points over larger fields and with torsion subgroups carrying Galois actions.

-- title:
--   EdgeClearGlue certificate definitions
-- statement:
--   This bundle defines the zero-free slab condition used to clear a rectangle boundary. Let $\mathcal D$ be the set of declarations it provides. Among its named definitions are
--
--   $$\mathcal D\supseteq\{\mathtt{EdgeClearGlue.SlabClear}\}.$$
--
--   The accompanying theorems establish the mathematical properties of these definitions.

/-  EdgeClearGlue.lean -- brick K1 of the ANDURIL Arb discharge
    (telperion/docs/ANDURIL_ARB_DISCHARGE_2026-09-23.md, section 1.3: `hArbT_nonvanishing_of_edge_clear`).

    Every emitted Turing band `RHInBoxT_*.rh_in_box_*` states the canonical
    `TuringBand.BandStatement` and takes an Arb binder `hArbT` with nine conjuncts.  The first four
    are non-vanishing and confinement facts about the RvM rectangle `[-1, 2] x [T0, T1]` and the
    Blaschke ball `ball c R` that covers it:

      hnzb : ∀ x ∈ [-1, 2], ζ(x + T0 i) ≠ 0                      (H2a, bottom edge)
      hnzt : ∀ x ∈ [-1, 2], ζ(x + T1 i) ≠ 0                      (H2a, top edge)
      hnzl : ∀ y ∈ [T0, T1], ζ(-1 + y i) ≠ 0                     (H2b, left edge)
      hins : every zero of ζ in `ball c R` lies in (-1, 2) x (T0, T1)   (H2c, confinement)

    This file derives all four from
      * `ZetaZeroConfinement.zeta_zero_re_mem_strip`: an off-real zero of ζ has 0 < Re < 1;
      * the ball geometry: three rational/sqrt inequalities about c, R, T0, T1 (decidable per band);
      * two EDGE-CLEARANCE facts, the memo's E(T0, δ0) and E(T1, δ1), as zero-free SLABS on the
        OUTER side of each edge: `SlabClear (T0 - δ0) T0` and `SlabClear T1 (T1 + δ1)`, where
        `SlabClear a b` says ζ has no zero with 0 < Re < 1 and a ≤ Im ≤ b.

    H2b needs no input at all: `hnzl_discharged` proves the conjunct for EVERY `T0`, `T1`, with no
    hypotheses (off the real axis by the strip theorem; at y = 0 by ζ(-1) = -1/12).  That removes
    one binder from each of the 10,379 bands of the h280000 ladder.

    What remains numerical after this file: two one-sided slab facts per band, about the open strip
    0 < Re < 1 only.  WHY ONE-SIDED, AND HOW TALL (measured on the h280000 ladder with the float
    zero list at grid 0.01, the tight cases refined with mpmath; untrusted numerics, design only):
      * ONE-SIDED: at about 2,831 band edges a zero lies on the INNER side of the edge closer than
        the ball cap (as close as the grid resolves), so even a two-sided window of half-height
        equal to the cap would be false there.  Inner-side zeros are counted by the band; only
        the outer side must be clear, and that is all `hins` needs.
      * TALL ENOUGH, NOT TOO TALL: the slab must reach past the ball cap (δ ≥ cap; caps are 0.0574
        to 0.0922) and must stop before the nearest zero beyond the edge.  The margin between the
        two is as small as 4.3e-5 (top edge 154974: cap 0.092160, zero at 154974.092203).  So δ
        must be the band's own cap rounded up finely (emit_band_glue.py uses 1e-6); a round
        δ = 1/10 would make the slab hypothesis false at about 385 of the 10,379 bands.

    Trust: no hypotheses beyond those named in each statement; axioms
    [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound] (see AxiomGuardBandGlue.lean).  No `sorry`.

    conjecture1_proved = False.  This is glue for a finite verification up to a fixed height; it
    says nothing about the Riemann Hypothesis. -/

/-! ## Edge clearance: zero-free slabs -/

/-- **Zero-free slab**: ζ has no zero with `0 < Re < 1` and `a ≤ Im ≤ b`.  The edge-clearance
    facts E(T0, δ0), E(T1, δ1) of the memo are `SlabClear (T0 - δ0) T0` (below the bottom edge)
    and `SlabClear T1 (T1 + δ1)` (above the top edge).  Outside `0 < Re < 1` the strip theorem
    already rules zeros out, so this is the only numerical input the four conjuncts need. -/

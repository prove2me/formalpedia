# The Asymptotic Ladder for Classical Factoring Barriers

This file develops the *quantitative* backbone of the conditional-impossibility
framework for classical integer factoring.  Every known classical factoring
resource comes with a running-time barrier, and each barrier is expressed in
terms of the bit-size parameter `x = log N`.

The three shapes that occur are

* `x ↦ exp (b * x)` (exponential; e.g. `N^{1/4}` for Pollard rho, `b = 1/4`);
* `Lfun α c x = exp (c * x^α * (log x)^(1-α))` (subexponential `L_N[α, c]`;
  e.g. `L_N[1/3,c]` for the number field sieve, `L_p[1/2,√2]` for ECM);
* `x ↦ C * x^d` (polynomial — the target of a hypothetical fast algorithm).

Main results:

* `Superpoly_exp_rpow`  : `exp (c * x^α)` is superpolynomial for `c, α > 0`;
* `Lfun_superpoly`      : `L[α,c]` is superpolynomial for `0 < α ≤ 1`, `c > 0`;
* `Lfun_subexp`         : `L[α,c]` is *sub*exponential for `0 < α < 1`;
* `not_polyBounded_of_superpoly` : a superpolynomial lower bound rules out
  polynomially bounded running time.

Together these say that the `L`-functions occupy a genuine intermediate rung of
the ladder: strictly above every polynomial and strictly below every exponential.

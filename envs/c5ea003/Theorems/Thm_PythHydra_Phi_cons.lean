-- statement:
--   Formal statement of `PythHydra.Phi_cons` from the Aether Catalog (Geometry). The mathematical content is given by the Lean statement below; a human-readable write-up is pending.

# The abstract hydra game underlying the Pythagorean Hydra

A *hydra* is a finite multiset of heads, each head carrying a natural number *level*.
Hercules chops one head; the hydra regrows an arbitrary finite multiset of new heads,
each of *strictly smaller* level.  In the Pythagorean Hydra of
`Catalog/Geometry/PythagoreanHydra/PythagoreanHydra.lean` the heads are primitive
Pythagorean triples and the regrown heads are Berggren ancestors of the chopped one, so
the level of a head is (a monotone function of) its position in the Berggren tree.

Two regimes are analysed here.

* **Bounded branching** (`HydraStep k`): at most `k` heads regrow.  The potential
  `Phi k H = ∑_{x ∈ H} (1 + k + ⋯ + k^x)` drops by *at least one* at every move
  (`hydraStep_Phi_succ_le`), and there is a strategy realising a drop of *exactly*
  one at every move (`exists_maximal_play`).  Hence the length of the longest play is
  **exactly** `Phi k H` (`longest_play_eq`), an explicit elementary function of the
  initial hydra: `Phi k H ≤ card H * (k+1)^(maxlevel+1)`.  This is the *calibration*
  result: the game is `ω^ω`-style, provably terminating by an explicit primitive
  recursive bound, and therefore has none of the proof-theoretic strength of the
  Kirby–Paris hydra (whose length function majorises every provably total function
  of Peano Arithmetic).

* **Unbounded branching** (`HydraStepU`): arbitrarily many heads may regrow.  Every
  play still terminates (`no_infinite_playU`, via the Dershowitz–Manna order), but the
  length is no longer bounded by any function of the initial hydra alone
  (`unbounded_play_length`), so the game's ordinal is genuinely `> ω`.

# The two-parameter ±-frame: coefficients of binary cyclotomic polynomials

## Research thread

The *±-frame* of order `n` is the `n`-th cyclotomic polynomial `Φₙ ∈ ℤ[X]`, viewed
as a signed frame: the interesting question is how negative a coefficient can be.

* **One-parameter case (already a theorem).**  For a prime `p`,
  `Φ_p = 1 + X + ⋯ + X^{p-1}`, so every coefficient is `0` or `1`; in particular
  every coefficient — the head coefficient included — is `≥ -1`.  This is
  `headCoeff_pmFrame_ge_neg_one` below.

* **Two-parameter case (this file).**  For two *distinct* primes `p ≠ q` the
  closed formula

      Φ_{pq}(X) · (X^{pq} - 1) = (X - 1) · G_{p,q}(X),
      G_{p,q}(X) = (∑_{i<q} X^{ip}) · (∑_{j<p} X^{jq})

  turns the question into a statement about **integer points in a
  two-dimensional region**: the coefficient of `X^n` in `G_{p,q}` counts the
  lattice points `(i,j)` of the box `[0,q) × [0,p)` on the line `ip + jq = n`,
  and the *balance / cycle-type* constraint `i < q`, `j < p` forces that count to
  be `0` or `1`.  Consequently

      Φ_{pq}.coeff n = G.coeff n - G.coeff (n-1) ∈ {-1, 0, 1}

  for every `n`, which is Migotti's theorem.  The arithmetic core is a pure
  `omega`/`nlinarith` statement about the box (`repPair_unique`).

* **Sharpness.**  The bound `-1` is attained: `Φ₁₅.coeff 7 = -1`
  (`coeff_pmFrame_fifteen_seven`), proved from the closed formula by counting the
  (empty) set of lattice points on `3i + 5j = 7` inside `[0,5) × [0,3)`.

* **Balance.**  `Φ_{pq}(1) = 1`, so along the frame the `+1`'s outnumber the
  `-1`'s by exactly one (`pmFrame_coeff_sum_eq_one`).

Everything is proved from scratch on top of mathlib's `Polynomial.cyclotomic`.

/-! ## 14. The coprimality boundary

Adversarial check: the whole argument rests on `repPair_unique`, whose only
input is coprimality of the two steps.  Without it the balance box really does
contain two lattice points on one line and the frame geometry acquires a
coefficient `2`, so the `{-1,0,1}` conclusion genuinely fails.  This pins down
coprimality as the exact boundary of the method. -/

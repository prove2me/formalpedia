# Hyperbolic–Pythagorean Geodesics, cycle III: quadratic ball growth

The first cycle proved that the hyperbolic ball of radius `R` around `i` contains at least
`e^{R-2} - 1` Berggren nodes, and conjectured (sub-conjecture **C1-lite**) the true order
`e^{2R}`: the number of nodes should grow like the *hypotenuse*, not like its square root.

This file proves that conjecture.  The obstruction is arithmetic, not geometric: one has to
produce quadratically many *coprime* pairs of opposite parity, which requires a sieve.

## Main results

* `card_multiples_Ioc` : the exact count of multiples of `k` in an interval `(a, b]`.
* `sum_inv_sq_odd`, `sum_inv_odd` : two telescoping estimates,
  `∑_{i<n} 1/(2i+3)² ≤ 1/4` and `∑_{i<n} 1/(2i+3) ≤ √(2n+1) - 1`.
* `card_seedBox_lower` : **the sieve bound.**  For `K ≥ 256` the box
  `{m even, 2K < m ≤ 4K} × {n odd, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2K}` contains at least `K²/4` Euclid seeds.
* `hyperbolic_ball_quadratic_growth` : **C1-lite, closed.**  For every `K ≥ 256` the
  hyperbolic ball of radius `R = log K + 2` around the base point contains at least
  `e^{2R}/300` distinct Berggren nodes.  Since every node with hypotenuse `c` sits at
  distance `≈ ½ log c`, this is the true order of growth, and it shows definitively that
  geodesic search through the Berggren tree cannot beat exhaustive search: the ball that
  is guaranteed to contain a colliding pair for `N` already contains `≍ N` nodes.

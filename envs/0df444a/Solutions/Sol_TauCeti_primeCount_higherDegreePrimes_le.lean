# Finite real-cutoff carriers for Northcott functions

This file packages the finite carrier selected by a real cutoff for a natural-valued Northcott
function, together with generic summatory functions over that carrier. The carrier depends only
on the integer part of the cutoff, and for a nonnegative cutoff it agrees with the one selected by
its natural floor.

# Counting carriers for ideals and prime ideals

Every estimate in the arithmetic-Dirichlet-series roadmap counts objects whose absolute norm does
not exceed a *real* cutoff `x`, and always inclusively: an object of norm exactly `x` is counted.
This file fixes that convention once.

The common core is Mathlib's `Northcott` property: a function `N : ι → ℕ` is Northcott when each
set `{i | N i ≤ B}` is finite.  For such an `N`:

* `TauCeti.normLE N x` is the finite set of indices with `(N i : ℝ) ≤ x`;
* `TauCeti.summatory N w x` is the inclusive sum of a weight `w` over `TauCeti.normLE N x`.

Two instances of this core carry the arithmetic content, `TauCeti.idealsLE` for the nonzero
integral ideals of `𝓞 K` and `TauCeti.primesLE` for the height-one primes, with
`TauCeti.idealSummatory`, `TauCeti.primeSummatory`, and `TauCeti.primePowerSummatory` the associated
summatory functions.  The
weighted prime counts of the roadmap are the two named specializations
`TauCeti.primeTheta`, the logarithmically weighted count, and `TauCeti.primeCount`, the
unweighted one; both are restricted to a set `S` of height-one primes through `Set.indicator`,
so no decidability hypothesis is needed on `S`.

A prime-power ideal is `𝔭 ^ k` for a unique height-one prime `𝔭` and a unique `k ≥ 1`;
`TauCeti.primePowerBase` and `TauCeti.primePowerExponent` name that pair, and
`TauCeti.idealPrimePower_eq_of_base_eq_of_exponent_eq` records that it determines the ideal.  The
exponent is `1` exactly on the primes themselves, which is `TauCeti.primePowerExponent_eq_one_iff`;
`TauCeti.IdealPrimePower.ofPrime` is the resulting inclusion of the prime carrier into the
prime-power carrier, and `TauCeti.primePowerSummatory_eq_primeSummatory` uses it to read a
prime-power sum concentrated on the exponent-one part as a sum over primes.

`TauCeti.idealsLE_filter_dvd` identifies the ideals below a cutoff divisible by a fixed nonzero
ideal `P` with the multiples of `P`, and `TauCeti.idealSummatory_ite_dvd` reads the corresponding
part of a summatory function at the rescaled cutoff `x / N(P)`.

Two lemmas move a summatory function between the three carriers.
`TauCeti.idealSummatory_eq_primePowerSummatory` reads an ideal weight vanishing off the prime
powers as a prime-power weight, and `TauCeti.idealSummatory_eq_sum_range_normFiber` regroups an
ideal summatory function into the partial sum, over `n ≤ ⌊x⌋₊`, of the total mass on the norm
fibre at `n`; `TauCeti.idealSummatory_eq_sum_Icc_normCoeff` writes the same regrouping as a
partial sum of `TauCeti.normCoeff`.  Together they present a sum over prime powers as a partial
sum of an `ArithmeticFunction`, which is the shape a Tauberian theorem consumes.

For `0 ≤ x`, a real cutoff and its floor select the same indices, so
`TauCeti.normLE_eq_normLE_natFloor` and `TauCeti.summatory_eq_summatory_natFloor` convert between
the real and natural conventions. The small-cutoff cases are degenerate for a reason worth
recording: a nonzero ideal has absolute norm at least `1`, and a height-one prime at least `2`, so
`TauCeti.idealsLE_one` isolates the unit ideal and `TauCeti.primesLE_eq_empty_of_lt_two` empties the
prime carrier below `2`.

Modifying a weight on a finite set, or a prime set on a finite symmetric difference, changes a
summatory function by a quantity that is eventually the *constant* total discrepancy; this is
`TauCeti.eventually_summatory_sub_eq` and its two prime specializations. Layer 7 uses these to
show that finite changes do not affect a density. In the same spirit,
`TauCeti.primeTheta_isLittleO_of_finite` records that a finite set of primes contributes an
eventually constant amount to `ϑ_K`, hence `o(x)`: an exceptional set can be discarded from a
counting argument outright, not merely from a density. Its `ψ` companion is
`TauCeti.primePsi_isLittleO_of_finite`.

## Roadmap role

This is Layer **4** of `TauCetiRoadmap/ArithmeticDirichletSeries/README.md`: the finite cutoff
carriers of 4.1, the generic summatory functions on ideals, primes, and prime powers of 4.2, and the
weighted prime counts `primeTheta` and `primeCount` of 4.3. Layer 5 supplies the actual size
estimates for these counts, and consumes the prime base and exponent of a prime-power ideal to
fibre those estimates over the primes.

# The residue degree of a height-one prime over `ℚ`

A height-one prime `𝔭` of `𝓞 K` lies over a unique rational prime `p`, and its absolute norm is
`p ^ f` for `f` the residue degree `Ideal.inertiaDeg 𝔭.asIdeal ℤ`.  This file names the two
objects that description involves and records their elementary theory.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.rationalPrimeBelow 𝔭` is the rational prime below a height-one prime `𝔭` of `𝓞 K`,
  namely the absolute norm of `𝔭 ∩ ℤ`.
* `TauCeti.higherDegreePrimes K` is the set of height-one primes of `𝓞 K` whose residue degree
  over `ℚ` exceeds `1`.
* `TauCeti.primesDividing K n hn` is the finite set of height-one primes of `𝓞 K` whose rational
  prime below divides a nonzero integer `n`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.absNorm_eq_rationalPrimeBelow_pow`: the absolute norm of `𝔭` is the rational prime
  below it raised to the residue degree.
* `TauCeti.mem_higherDegreePrimes_iff_not_prime_absNorm`: a height-one prime has residue degree
  above one exactly when its absolute norm is not a prime number.
* `TauCeti.rationalPrimeBelow_pow_le_absNorm`: the norm of `𝔭` is at least the rational prime
  below it raised to any power at most the residue degree.
* `TauCeti.mem_higherDegreePrimes_of_one_lt_inertiaDeg`: residue degree above one over an
  intermediate number field forces residue degree above one over `ℚ`.
* `TauCeti.card_filter_rationalPrimeBelow_le_finrank`: at most `[K : ℚ]` height-one primes have
  a given rational prime below them.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.encard_setOf_under_eq_le_finrank`: at most `[E : K]`
  height-one primes of `E` contract to a given height-one prime of an intermediate number field
  `K`.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.absNorm_dvd_rationalPrimeBelow_pow_finrank`: the absolute
  norm of `𝔭` divides `p ^ [K : ℚ]`, so the residue degree is at most the degree of the field.
* `TauCeti.asIdeal_eq_span_singleton_of_absNorm_eq_pow_finrank`: a prime of full residue degree
  is inert, that is, generated by the rational prime below it.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.intCast_mem_asIdeal_iff`: an integer belongs to a
  height-one prime exactly when the rational prime below it divides that integer.
* `TauCeti.mem_primesDividing`: the defining condition for membership in `primesDividing`.

## Implementation notes

`rationalPrimeBelow` is named rather than spelled out as `Ideal.absNorm (Ideal.under ℤ 𝔭.asIdeal)`
because the estimates downstream fibre the primes over it: keeping it a single head symbol is what
makes the fibrewise rewriting elaborate, and it is the object `Chebotarev` will name when it
compares a prime of `K` with the rational prime under it.

# The primes of residue degree above one are negligible

A height-one prime `𝔭` of `𝓞 K` lies over a unique rational prime `p`, and its absolute norm is
`p ^ f` for `f` the residue degree `Ideal.inertiaDeg 𝔭.asIdeal ℤ`.  This file bounds the
contribution of the primes with `f ≥ 2`, the set `TauCeti.higherDegreePrimes K`: they number
`O(√x)` up to norm `x`, hence also `o(x / log x)`, and their Dirichlet series `∑ N(𝔭) ^ (-s)`
converges for every `s > 1/2`, with a bound that is uniform on `s ≥ 1`.

Two elementary inputs carry the whole argument.

* A prime with `f ≥ 2` has `N(𝔭) = p ^ f ≥ p ^ 2`, so it is *not* determined by a rational prime
  of size `N(𝔭)` but by one of size at most `√(N(𝔭))`.
* At most `[K : ℚ]` height-one primes lie over one rational prime, by the fundamental identity
  `∑ e f = [K : ℚ]`; this is the already available
  `TauCeti.card_filter_rationalPrimeBelow_le_finrank`, itself resting on
  `TauCeti.NumberField.card_primesOverFinset_le_finrank`.

Together these compare any finite sum over the degree-above-one primes with `[K : ℚ]` times a sum
over the rational primes with the exponent doubled, which is
`TauCeti.sum_absNorm_rpow_higherDegreePrimes_le_finrank_mul_tsum` below.  Counting gives the
`O(√x)` bound, and summing `m ^ (-2s)` gives convergence for every `s > 1/2` together with a
bound on the partial Dirichlet series that is *uniform* on `s ≥ 1`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.primeCount_higherDegreePrimes_le`: the explicit count
  `π_K(x; f ≥ 2) ≤ [K : ℚ] · √x`, with `TauCeti.primeCount_higherDegreePrimes_isBigO` and
  `TauCeti.primeCount_higherDegreePrimes_isLittleO` its `O(√x)` and `o(x / log x)` forms.
* `TauCeti.summable_absNorm_rpow_higherDegreePrimes`: `∑ N(𝔭) ^ (-s)` over the degree-above-one
  primes converges for every `s > 1/2`, in particular at `s = 1`.
* `TauCeti.primeTheta_higherDegreePrimes_isLittleO`: those primes carry weight `o(x)` in `ϑ_K`.
* `TauCeti.primeIdealZetaSum_higherDegreePrimes_le`: that sum, in Mathlib's
  `NumberField.Set.primeIdealZetaSum` vocabulary, is at most `2 [K : ℚ]` for every `s ≥ 1`.
* `TauCeti.sum_absNorm_rpow_le_finrank_mul_tsum` and
  `TauCeti.tsum_absNorm_rpow_le_finrank_mul_tsum`: the same fibring over *all* height-one primes,
  in finite and infinite form, for every `s > 1`.
* `TauCeti.tsum_absNorm_rpow_neg_two_le`: at `s = 2` that becomes the explicit
  `∑_𝔭 N(𝔭) ^ (-2) ≤ 2 [K : ℚ]`.

No density-zero statement is proved here.  What this file supplies is the numerator half of
one: `NumberField.Set.HasDirichletDensity (higherDegreePrimes K) 0` asks for
`primeIdealZetaSum (higherDegreePrimes K) s / primeIdealZetaSum univ s → 0` as `s → 1⁺`, and the
bound below controls only the numerator.  Together with the divergence of the denominator it gives
`TauCeti.hasDirichletDensity_higherDegreePrimes` in
`TauCeti.NumberTheory.ArithmeticDirichletSeries.DirichletDensity.Negligible`.  By contrast
`primeCount K (higherDegreePrimes K) =o[atTop] primeCount K univ`
would need a lower bound on the full prime count, which the prime ideal theorem supplies and
which is not available here; the `o(x / log x)` statement below is against the explicit
function `x / log x`, not against `π_K`.

## Implementation notes

The set `TauCeti.higherDegreePrimes` and the map `TauCeti.rationalPrimeBelow` the estimates fibre
over, together with their elementary norm and inertia theory, are algebraic rather than analytic
and live in `TauCeti.NumberTheory.NumberField.ResidueDegree`.

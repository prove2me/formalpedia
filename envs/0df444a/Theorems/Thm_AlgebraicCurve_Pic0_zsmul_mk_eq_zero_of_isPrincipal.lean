-- title:
--   Torsion criterion in Pic⁰: mD principal kills m[D]
-- statement:
--   Let $K$ and $F$ be fields with $F$ a $K$-algebra. A place of $F/K$, in the sense used here, is a valuation subring of $F$ that contains the image of $K$ under the structure map, is not all of $F$, and is a principal ideal ring; a divisor is a finitely supported function from places to $\mathbb{Z}$, its degree is $\sum_v D(v)\cdot v.\mathrm{deg}$, and `Divisor.degZero` is the subgroup of divisors of degree zero. A divisor $D$ is principal when there is $f \in F$, $f \neq 0$, with $D(v) = v.\mathrm{ord}(f)$ for every place $v$; the principal divisors form a subgroup, and `Pic0` is the quotient of `Divisor.degZero` by the intersection of that subgroup with `Divisor.degZero`, with `Pic0.mk` the quotient map. The assertion is: given a degree-zero divisor $D$ and an integer $m$ such that the divisor $m \cdot D$ is principal, i.e. $m \cdot D(v) = v.\mathrm{ord}(f)$ for all $v$ for some nonzero $f \in F$, one has $m \cdot \mathrm{Pic0.mk}(D) = 0$ in `Pic0`. Note that $m$ is an arbitrary integer, not required to be positive, and $D$ is an arbitrary degree-zero divisor.

--   This is the standard bookkeeping step by which an explicit function with divisor $mD$ exhibits the class of $D$ as $m$-torsion in the degree-zero divisor class group — the mechanism behind statements such as a modular unit with divisor $m((0)-(\infty))$ annihilating $m$ times the cuspidal class. It is used in the integral-form variant [`AlgebraicCurve.Pic0.nsmul_mk_eq_zero_of_isPrincipal`](thm.html#AlgebraicCurve.Pic0.nsmul_mk_eq_zero_of_isPrincipal) and in the specialization arguments for modular curves that produce classes killed by a given integer.

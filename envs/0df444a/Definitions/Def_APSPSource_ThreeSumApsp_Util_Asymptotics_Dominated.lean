-- title:
--   Uniform upper domination on a specified domain
-- statement:
--   Let $X$ be a type, $D$ a predicate on $X$, and $f,g:X\to\mathbb R$. Define upper domination on $D$ by
--
--   $$f\preccurlyeq_D g\iff\exists C\in\mathbb R,\ C\ge0\ \land\ \forall x\in X,\ D(x)\Rightarrow f(x)\le Cg(x).$$
--
--   The same constant must work for every point of the stated domain. The inequality bounds $f$, rather than its absolute value; neither function is assumed nonnegative by this definition.
--
--   This predicate records uniform cost estimates in several parameters before they are specialized to asymptotic bounds in one input size.

# Bounds up to a constant factor, in several parameters

The paper writes `f = O(g)` for functions of several parameters that are tied by side conditions,
such as `D ^ 18 ≤ n` for the parameters `n`, `D`, `w`. `Dominated dom f g` says this: there is a
constant `C ≥ 0` with `f x ≤ C * g x` for every tuple `x` of parameters that satisfies `dom x`. If
there is no side condition, `dom` is `fun _ => True`. The type `α` of the parameters is best a
structure with one named field for each of them, so that a bound reads
`Dominated (fun p => p.D ^ 18 ≤ p.n) (fun p => cost p) fun p => p.n ^ 2 / p.D`.

The lemmas of this file are the steps that the paper takes without comment: such bounds can be
chained (`Dominated.trans`), added (`Dominated.add`, `Dominated.add_add`), multiplied and divided
(`Dominated.mul`, `Dominated.mul_left`, `Dominated.const_mul`, `Dominated.pow`,
`Dominated.div_right`), joined by a case distinction (`Dominated.ite`), restricted to a smaller
domain (`Dominated.mono_dom`) and specialized (`Dominated.comp`). With them no proof has to name a
constant. A bound enters the calculus by `Dominated.of_le`, `Dominated.of_le_const_mul` or
`Dominated.of_exists_const`, and leaves it by `obtain ⟨C, hC, hle⟩` or `Dominated.exists_const_and`.
For functions of one natural number, `Dominated.of_eventually` takes a bound for all large `n`,
`Dominated.isBigO` gives Mathlib's `f =O[atTop] g`, and `isBigO_comp_add_one` substitutes a size
that need not tend to infinity.

In every closure lemma the bound comes first and the side conditions follow.

For nonnegative `f` and `g` the notion is Mathlib's `f =O[𝓟 {x | dom x}] g`, big-O along the
principal filter of the domain (`dominated_iff_isBigO_principal`). The one-sided form is taken
because a running time is bounded from above only.

## The notions of "bounded up to a constant" in this library

* `f =O[atTop] g` of Mathlib bounds `|f|` for large `n`. In this sense `IsBigOPow f a` is `O(n^a)`,
  `IsPowPolylog f a` is `O(n^a (log n)^e)` for some `e`, and `IsPowLittleO f a` is `n^{a+o(1)}`.
  The exponents of the theorems are stated with them.
* `UpperBigOPow`, `UpperPowPolylog` and `UpperPowLittleO` are the same three classes as bounds on
  `f` and not on `|f|`, for running times. A two-sided bound gives the one-sided one
  (`IsBigOPow.upperBigOPow`, `IsPowPolylog.upperPowPolylog`, `IsPowLittleO.upperPowLittleO`).
* `Dominated dom f g` bounds `f` on the whole domain, for several parameters. It comes from a bound
  for large `n` by `Dominated.of_eventually` and gives one by `Dominated.isBigO`.
* `Scale.SoftO t e` says that a count `t` with values in `ℕ` is `Dominated` by a monomial with the
  exponents `e`, up to powers of one more quantity; the tactic `growth` reads the exponents off an
  explicit expression. It gives a `Dominated` bound by `Scale.SoftO.dominated`. Its instance
  `SoftOSqrtPow` gives `IsPowPolylog` by `SoftOSqrtPow.isPowPolylog`.

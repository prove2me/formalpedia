-- title:
--   The first-coordinate projection $\mathbb{R}^{2N+1} \to \mathbb{R}^{N}$ is onto
-- statement:
--   For every natural number $N$, the linear map that reads off the first $N$ coordinates of a vector in $\mathbb{R}^{2N+1}$ is surjective: every prescribed tuple of $N$ real numbers is realised by some vector.
--   $$ \pi_N : \mathbb{R}^{2N+1} \to \mathbb{R}^{N}, \qquad v \mapsto (v_1,\dots,v_N), \qquad \operatorname{range}(\pi_N) = \mathbb{R}^{N}. $$
--   Explicitly, a target $w \in \mathbb{R}^{N}$ is hit by the vector whose first $N$ coordinates equal $w$ and whose remaining $N+1$ coordinates are $0$. Surjectivity is what turns the rank-nullity count for $\pi_N$ into the exact kernel dimension $N+1$ used in Lemma 24.1.

  Source: `auditable_full_proof_nag_and_five_algorithm_cn.md`, section 24
  (lines ~2175-2251), Lemma 24.1 and equations (24.1)-(24.5).

  The source document fixes the dimension

      D = 2 N + 1                                              (23.1)

  and, after fixing the seed, obtains `N` query points `q_1, ..., q_N ∈ ℝ^D`
  which are completely determined by `N`, `D` and the public sampling rule;
  in particular the query positions do not depend on function values.  It then
  asks for a *nonzero* vector `v` with

      v_1 = ... = v_N = 0,                                     (24.1)
      ⟨v, q_i⟩ = 0        for i = 1, ..., N,                   (24.2)

  and proves (Lemma 24.1) that such a `v` necessarily exists.

  Formalisation notes.

  * `Fin N` is the Lean index type for `i = 1, ..., N`; the source index `i`
    corresponds to `Fin` value `i - 1`.  Accordingly (24.1) -- `v_1 = ... = v_N = 0`
    -- says that the first `N` coordinates `v 0, ..., v (N-1)` vanish, which is
    encoded as `∀ i : Fin N, v (Fin.castLE _ i) = 0`; the map
    `Fin.castLE (by omega : N ≤ 2 * N + 1)` is the inclusion of the first `N`
    coordinates into `Fin (2 * N + 1)`.

  * The ambient space is `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (2 * N + 1))`, i.e. `Fin D → ℝ`
    with the Pi inner product, exactly as in the source.

  * Lemma 24.1 is *proved*, not assumed: `exists_nonzero_orthogonal_of_finrank_succ`
    below isolates the pure dimension argument of the source ("the last `N + 1`
    coordinates span a subspace of dimension `N + 1`; the `N` homogeneous
    orthogonality conditions impose at most `N` independent linear constraints;
    hence the common kernel has dimension at least `(N + 1) - N = 1`"), and
    `finrank_vanishingFirstBlock` computes the dimension of the constrained
    subspace.  No axiom, `sorry` or `unsafe` is used anywhere in this file.

  * (24.3) writes `u = v / ‖v‖`.  This Mathlib revision has no scalar-division
    instance on `EuclideanSpace`, so the division is written as multiplication
    by `‖v‖⁻¹` (`normalizeVec`); `normalizeVec_eq` records the equality with the
    source's `v / ‖v‖`.

/-! ## Lemma 24.1, abstract dimension argument

The source's proof only uses: a subspace of dimension `N + 1` in a real inner
product space, and `N` homogeneous linear constraints `⟨·, q i⟩ = 0`.  We prove
that abstract statement first, so that the dimension count is auditable on its
own, independently of the concrete coordinates in `Fin (2 * N + 1)`. -/



/-! ## The concrete subspace of (24.1)

`firstBlockProj N` is the linear map `v ↦ (v 0, ..., v (N-1))` that reads off the
first `N` coordinates of a vector of `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (2 * N + 1))`; its
kernel is the subspace cut out by the conditions (24.1). -/

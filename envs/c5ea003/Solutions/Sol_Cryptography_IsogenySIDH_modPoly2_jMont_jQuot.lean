# The radical Montgomery step is a genuine edge of the 2-isogeny graph

`RadicalMontgomeryFormula` produced an explicit rational map from `E_A` to a
generalized Montgomery curve with parameter `radTwoParam A α = (A+6)/(2α)`,
`α² = A + 2`.  That is a *local* verification: the formulas transport points.
This file supplies the *global* certificate that the construction really is a
2-isogeny, by checking it against the classical modular polynomial `Φ₂`.

The main results are:

* `jMont_radTwoParam` — the `j`-invariant of the target is
  `jQuot A = 16 (A²+12)³ / (A²-4)²`.  Remarkably the radical `α` cancels: the
  target `j` is a *rational* function of `A`.
* `jMont_model_independent` — the three Montgomery renormalisations of the
  quotient curve (obtained by moving each of its three two-torsion points to
  the origin, using the three radicals `√(A+2)`, `√(2-A)`, `√(A²-4)`) all have
  the same `j`-invariant `jQuot A`.  So the radical step is independent of the
  chosen model and of the sign of the radical.
* `modPoly2_jMont_jQuot` and `modPoly2_radical_step` — the pair
  `(j(E_A), j(E_{A'}))` is a zero of the level-2 modular polynomial `Φ₂`.  This
  is the definitive certificate of 2-isogeny, proved as a polynomial identity
  of degree 54 in `A`.
* `radChain_isTwoIsogenyPath` — an admissible radical walk traces a path in the
  2-isogeny graph, by induction along the walk.
* `two_isogeny_neighbours_card_le_three` — `Φ₂` is monic of degree three in each
  variable, so every vertex of the 2-isogeny graph has at most three neighbours;
  this bounds the branching of a radical walk and is what makes the walk a walk
  on a cubic (Ramanujan) graph.

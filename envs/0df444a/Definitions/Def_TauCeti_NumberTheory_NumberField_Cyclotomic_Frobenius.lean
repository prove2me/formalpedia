-- title:
--   The arithmetic Frobenius on roots of unity
-- statement:
--   Let $\zeta$ be an $m$-th root of unity in an extension of a number field $K$. At a prime $P$ not dividing $m$, an arithmetic Frobenius $\sigma$ at a prime above $P$ satisfies
--
--   $$
--   \sigma(\zeta)=\zeta^{\mathrm N P}.
--   $$
--
--   For a primitive root, its cyclotomic-character value is therefore the norm of $P$ modulo $m$. This fixes the arithmetic Frobenius convention.

# The arithmetic Frobenius on roots of unity

Let `K` be a number field, `F` an extension field of `K`, `𝔭` a height-one prime of `𝓞 K`, and
`Q` an ideal of `𝓞 F` lying over `𝔭`. An *arithmetic Frobenius* at `Q` is a `σ` with
`σ x ≡ x ^ 𝔑𝔭 (mod Q)` for every `x : 𝓞 F` (Mathlib's `IsArithFrobAt`). This file records what
such a `σ` does to a root of unity: if `ζ` is an `m`-th root of unity in `F` and `𝔭` does not
divide `m`, then

`σ ζ = ζ ^ 𝔑𝔭`.

Over `ℚ` this reads `ζ_m ↦ ζ_m ^ p`, so the cyclotomic character sends the Frobenius at `p` to
`p mod m`. The exponent is `𝔑𝔭` itself and not `𝔑𝔭⁻¹`: the inverse describes the *geometric*
Frobenius, and using it would reverse the arithmetic progression a character reads off.

Some hypothesis relating `m` to `𝔭` is genuinely necessary rather than an artifact of the proof.
In the intended setting `F = K(μ_m)`, taking `μ_m ⊆ K` collapses `F` to `K`, making every `σ` the
identity; the formula would then force `𝔑𝔭 ≡ 1 (mod m)` for every prime. Here the hypothesis is
`(m : 𝓞 K) ∉ 𝔭.asIdeal`, that is `𝔭 ∤ m`, imposed at the base prime where a caller can check
it rather than at `Q`.

## Main results

* `AlgHom.IsArithFrobAt.apply_eq_pow_absNorm_of_pow_eq_one`: an arithmetic Frobenius at an ideal
  of `𝓞 F` over `𝔭` raises an `m`-th root of unity to the power `𝔑𝔭`, when `𝔭 ∤ m`.
* `AlgHom.IsArithFrobAt.autToPow_eq_absNorm`: equivalently, the cyclotomic character
  `IsPrimitiveRoot.autToPow` sends such a Frobenius to `𝔑𝔭 mod m`.

## Implementation notes

The statement takes an element `σ` together with `IsArithFrobAt (𝓞 K) σ Q` rather than a chosen
Frobenius. It therefore applies to every arithmetic Frobenius at `Q`, needs no finiteness of the
residue ring `𝓞 F ⧸ Q` (which a chosen Frobenius needs in order to exist), and lets a consumer
supply whichever representative it holds.

`ζ` is asked only for `ζ ^ m = 1`, not for `IsPrimitiveRoot ζ m`. Primitivity plays no part: the
underlying `IsArithFrobAt.apply_of_pow_eq_one` is itself stated for any root of unity, and a
caller holding `hζ : IsPrimitiveRoot ζ m` passes `hζ.pow_eq_one`. Nor is `[NeZero m]` assumed —
`hm` already forces `m ≠ 0`, since every ideal contains `0`. Being a root of unity is also what
makes `ζ` an algebraic integer here (`IsIntegral.of_pow`), so no cyclotomic structure is needed to
package it into `𝓞 F`.

The statement uses the monoid-action `IsArithFrobAt`, whose head symbol unfolds to
`AlgHom.IsArithFrobAt`; the theorem lives in that namespace so a caller can write
`hσ.apply_eq_pow_absNorm_of_pow_eq_one`, matching Mathlib's own `apply_of_pow_eq_one`. Inside
that namespace the bare name `IsArithFrobAt` would resolve to the two-argument `AlgHom` form,
so the hypothesis names the monoid-action abbrev as `_root_.IsArithFrobAt`.

There is likewise no cyclotomic hypothesis on `F / K`. `IsCyclotomicExtension {m} K F` is the
ambient setting in which the result gets used, but the proof never looks at it, so assuming it
would leave an unused hypothesis on the statement. For the same reason `F` is not assumed to be a
number field: only `K` has to be one, so that `𝔭` has an absolute norm. And `Q`, which in use is a
prime above `𝔭`, is only required to lie over it: `IsArithFrobAt` reads as a congruence modulo `Q`
for any ideal, and nothing below needs `Q` to be prime.

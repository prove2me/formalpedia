# Emergent geometry from entanglement: the min-cut entropy cone

This file develops, from scratch, the mathematics behind the slogan
*"spacetime geometry is built out of entanglement"* in a finite, fully rigorous
setting.

A **bulk geometry** is a finite weighted graph (symmetric, nonnegative weights):
this is the discrete stand-in for a spatial slice of an asymptotically AdS
geometry, the weight of an edge playing the role of the area of the surface
element separating two bulk cells.  Some vertices are declared **boundary**
vertices; these carry the CFT degrees of freedom.

The **entanglement entropy** of a boundary region `A` is the *min-cut*
(Ryu–Takayanagi) prescription: the minimum cut weight over all bulk regions
whose boundary trace is exactly `A`.

The main results proved here are the *holographic entropy inequalities* of this
model, obtained from purely combinatorial (Boolean) pointwise inequalities on
separation indicators:

* `entropy_subadditive`         : `S(A ∪ B) ≤ S(A) + S(B)`
* `entropy_strong_subadditive`  : `S(A∪B) + S(B∪C) ≥ S(A∪B∪C) + S(B)`
* `entropy_monogamy` (**MMI**)  : `S(A∪B)+S(B∪C)+S(A∪C) ≥ S(A)+S(B)+S(C)+S(A∪B∪C)`
* `entropy_complement`          : purity, `S(A) = S(bdry \ A)`

The key technical engine is `cutWeight_comb`: a family of cuts dominates another
family as soon as the corresponding Boolean separation indicators do so
pointwise.  Strong subadditivity comes from submodularity of the cut function
(`sepBit_submodular`), and monogamy from a *minority/union* recombination of
three cuts, whose 64-case Boolean verification is `sepBit_mmi`.

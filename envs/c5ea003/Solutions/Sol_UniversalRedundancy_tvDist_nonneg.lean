# The Price of Universality VIII: rigidity — the equality cases

Eighth instalment of the thread *Compression Beyond the Pigeonhole Bound*.
Parts I–VII established the two *sharp bounds* for the Shtarkov sum of a finite
source class,

`1 ≤ Cₛ ≤ #Θ`,

together with the closure laws that keep a class inside the `1`-sum (simplex)
world: products, tied products, reindexings.  Both endpoints were known to be
*attained* (`shtarkovSum_of_subsingleton`, `shtarkovSum_eq_card_of_disjoint_supports`).
What was missing is the **equality analysis**: which classes sit exactly at an
endpoint, and how far a class is from an endpoint when it misses it.

## Central Idea

The whole rigidity picture follows from a single *exact identity* that upgrades
the inequality `Cₛ ≤ #Θ` to a conservation law:

`Cₛ + Ω = #Θ`,   where   `Ω = ∑ₓ (∑_θ p_θ x − sup_θ p_θ x) ≥ 0`

is the **overlap** of the class — the probability mass that the sources share.
Every equality statement below is read off from `Ω`:

* `Ω = 0` ⟺ the sources are mutually singular ⟺ `Cₛ = #Θ` (maximal price);
* at the other end, `Cₛ = 1` forces `p_θ = sup_θ p_θ` pointwise, i.e. *all*
  sources coincide — no non-trivial class is free;
* for a two-source class the identity becomes the exact formula
  `Cₛ = 1 + d_TV(p, q)`, so the price of universality of a pair is *literally*
  the total variation distance, interpolating between the two rigid endpoints;
* consequently `1 + max_{θ≠θ'} d_TV(p_θ, p_θ') ≤ Cₛ` for every class: pairwise
  statistical separation is a lower bound on the universality price.

The same "sum of a pointwise inequality" analysis, applied to the *induction*
behind the tied-product law of Part VII, produces the equality criterion for
subadditivity: sharing a parameter across two blocks costs the full additive
price iff every pair of block outcomes admits a **common maximiser**.

## Main Results

* `SourceClass.overlap`, `shtarkovSum_add_overlap_eq_card` — the conservation law
* `SourceClass.MutuallySingular`, `shtarkovSum_eq_card_iff_mutuallySingular` —
  the upper endpoint is rigid
* `shtarkovSum_lt_card_of_overlap` — any shared message strictly lowers the price
* `shtarkovSum_eq_card_iff_exists_supports` — iff-form of Part I's partition
  criterion (`shtarkovSum_eq_card_of_disjoint_supports` is the easy direction)
* `shtarkovSum_eq_one_iff_forall_eq` — the lower endpoint is rigid: converse of
  the calibration law `shtarkovSum_of_subsingleton`
* `logb_shtarkovSum_eq_zero_iff`, `logb_shtarkovSum_eq_logb_card_iff` — the two
  rigidity theorems in bits
* `tvDist`, `shtarkovSum_pair_eq_one_add_tvDist` — exact two-source formula
* `one_add_tvDist_le_shtarkovSum`, `shtarkovSum_le_one_add_sum_tvDist` —
  a total-variation sandwich for the price of any class
* `shtarkovSum_le_card_sub_one_add_tvDist` — quantitative stability: one close
  pair already pulls the price away from the maximum
* `sum_pairs_affinity_le_overlap`, `shtarkovSum_le_card_sub_avg_affinity` —
  all-pairs stability: the average pairwise affinity is a deficit from the
  maximal price
* `reindexClass`, `shtarkovSum_reindexClass_eq_iff` — equality case of the
  monotonicity law
* `shtarkovSum_tiedProdClass_eq_iff` — equality analysis of the tied-product
  induction of Part VII, and `shtarkovSum_tiedProdClass_lt` for the strict case
* `pointMassClass`, `shtarkovSum_pointMassClass`,
  `shtarkovSum_tiedProdClass_pointMass` — a worked extremal family witnessing
  both endpoints and strict subadditivity
* `sum_maxLik_fiber_le_one`, `shtarkovSum_eq_card_statistic_iff` — equality
  analysis of the sufficient-statistic bound of Part II

Computed with `ℚ` arithmetic on explicit classes, `Cₛ = ∑ₓ max_θ p_θ x`:

* `p = (1/2, 1/3, 1/6)`, `q = (1/4, 1/4, 1/2)`:  `Cₛ = 4/3 = 1 + d_TV`.
* `p = (1, 0, 0)`,       `q = (0, 1/2, 1/2)`:    `Cₛ = 2   = 1 + d_TV` (singular).
* three copies of the uniform law on three letters: `Cₛ = 1`, overlap `Ω = 2`,
  so `Cₛ + Ω = 3 = #Θ`.
* all `8³ = 512` classes of three sources on three letters drawn from the
  palette `(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (½,½,0), (½,0,½), (0,½,½), (⅓,⅓,⅓),
  (¼,¼,½)`: the predicate `Cₛ = 3` agreed with mutual singularity in every
  single case (0 disagreements) — the experiment behind
  `shtarkovSum_eq_card_iff_mutuallySingular`.
* tied product of two point-mass blocks on two letters: `Cₛ(tied) = 2` versus
  `Cₛ · Cₛ = 4` — the experiment behind `shtarkovSum_tiedProdClass_pointMass_lt`.

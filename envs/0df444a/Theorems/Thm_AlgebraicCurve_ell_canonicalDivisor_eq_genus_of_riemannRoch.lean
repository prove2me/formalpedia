-- title:
--   ℓ of a canonical divisor equals the genus
-- statement:
--   Let $K$ and $F$ be fields with $F$ a $K$-algebra, and assume `IsCurveOver K F`: every nonzero $f \in F$ has a principal divisor, i.e. a finitely supported function on the places `Place K F` of $F/K$ whose value at $v$ is $\operatorname{ord}_v(f)$ and whose degree is $0$; each place has residue field finite over $K$; and $\Omega_{F/K}$ is free of rank $1$ over $F$. Assume `HasCanonicalDivisor`: for every nonzero $\omega \in \Omega_{F/K}$ there is a divisor whose value at each place $v$ is $v.\mathrm{ordDifferential}\,\omega = \operatorname{ord}_v$ of the differential coefficient of $\omega$ at $v$; `canonicalDivisorOf` selects such a divisor. Assume further that for each place $v$ the differential $d(\pi_v)$ of a uniformiser spans $\Omega_{F/K}$ over $F$. Two further hypotheses are assumed: `FunctionFieldRiemannRoch K F`, i.e. $\ell(D) - \ell(\mathrm{canonicalDivisorOf}\,h_\omega - D) = \deg D + 1 - g$ for every nonzero differential and every divisor $D$, where $\ell(D)$ is the $K$-dimension of the Riemann–Roch space of $D$ and $g$ is `genus K F`, defined as $(\deg(\text{a canonical divisor}) + 2)/2$ truncated to $\mathbb{N}$; and `ConstantsAreBase K F`, i.e. the Riemann–Roch space of the zero divisor is exactly the image of $K$ in $F$. Then for every nonzero $\omega \in \Omega_{F/K}$ one has $\ell(\mathrm{canonicalDivisorOf}\,h_\omega) = g$ as integers.

--   This is the standard consequence of Riemann–Roch at $D = 0$: the space of global differentials has dimension equal to the genus, here in the divisor-theoretic form $\ell((\omega)) = g$ for the function field $F/K$ of a curve. It is used in the identification of this canonical-degree genus with the genus attached to the function field, [`AlgebraicCurve.genus_eq_genusFF`](thm.html#AlgebraicCurve.genus_eq_genusFF).

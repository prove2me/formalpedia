# Integrability threshold for the lattice-minima height

Let `α` be the homothety-invariant normalised lattice-minima height on the standard
arithmetic quotient of the Bruhat–Tits building of `PGL_d(F_q((t^{-1})))`, modelled as in
`Algebra.PGLQuotient.VertexModel`.

The main theorem of this file is the *exact integrability threshold*

`Summable (fun g => vertexWeight q g * α g ^ s) ↔ s < d`,

i.e. `α ∈ L^r` precisely for `r < d` (in particular for `0 < r < d`).  The positive direction
is proved by factoring the majorant into a product of `d-1` independent geometric series over
the gap coordinates; the negative direction uses the cusp ray `λ = (n,0,…,0)`, along which the
mass decays exactly like `α^{-d}`.

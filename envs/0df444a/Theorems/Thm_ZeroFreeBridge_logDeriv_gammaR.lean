-- title:
--   Gamma-factor logarithmic derivative in the right half-plane
-- statement:
--   For $s\in\mathbb C$ with $\operatorname{Re}(s/2)>0$, the real gamma factor and
--   complex digamma function satisfy
--   $$\operatorname{logDeriv}\Gamma_{\mathbb R}(s)
--   =-\tfrac12\log\pi+\tfrac12\psi(s/2).$$
--   This is the gamma contribution to the logarithmic derivative of completed zeta.

/- TURING RUNG T2, brick 1: the Riemann–Siegel theta function, defined BRANCH-CUT-FREE as the
   integral of an explicit real integrand (TURING_METHOD_SCOPING §3, rung T2).

   Classically `θ(t) = Im logΓ(1/4 + it/2) − (t/2)·log π` with a continuously-tracked branch of
   `logΓ` — awkward to formalize.  Instead we DEFINE

     `θ(t) := ∫_0^t ( (1/2)·Re ψ(1/4 + i·u/2) − (1/2)·log π ) du`,

   where `ψ = Complex.digamma = logDeriv Γ` (Mathlib).  This agrees with the classical `θ`
   (both vanish at `0` and have the same derivative `θ'(u) = (1/2)·Re ψ(1/4 + iu/2) − (1/2)·log π`)
   and needs NO branch tracking: the integrand is a plain continuous real function of `u`.

   This brick: the ray `1/4 + (u/2)·i` avoids all Γ-poles (`Re = 1/4 > 0`), Γ is ANALYTIC there
   (differentiable on the open right half-plane ⟹ analytic), `ψ` is continuous on the ray
   (`deriv Γ / Γ`, with `Γ ≠ 0` by `Gamma_ne_zero_of_re_pos`), hence the integrand is continuous,
   `θ` is well-defined with `θ(0) = 0` and `θ' = integrand` (FTC for continuous integrands).

   Later bricks (T2 cont.): effective two-sided bounds `θ(t) = (t/2)log(t/2π) − t/2 − π/8 +
   O*(explicit/t)` via Binet-type digamma estimates; then T3 wires `θ` into the rectangle
   argument identity `N(T) = θ(T)/π + 1 + S(T)`.

/-! ## Brick 2: the Archimedean bridge — `θ'` IS the `Gammaℝ` log-derivative on the critical line.

`Gammaℝ s = π^(-s/2)·Γ(s/2)` is the Archimedean factor of the completed zeta
(`Λ = Gammaℝ · ζ` up to the `s(s-1)` polynomial), the object the T3 rectangle identity
splits off of `logDeriv Λ`.  We compute `logDeriv Gammaℝ s = -(log π)/2 + (1/2)·ψ(s/2)`
on `Re(s/2) > 0` and specialize to the critical line `s = 1/2 + iu`, where `s/2 = thetaRay u`:
the θ integrand is EXACTLY `Re (logDeriv Gammaℝ (1/2 + iu))`.  This hard-wires the
branch-cut-free `θ` into the counting formula's Archimedean term. -/

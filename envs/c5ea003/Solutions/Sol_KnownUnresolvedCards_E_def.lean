# Known versus unresolved cards — I. The uniform expectation calculus

A *prediction game* pays a rational amount on each of finitely many **cards**.
Some cards are **resolved**: the predictor knows their value and collects a
deterministic unit payoff.  The remaining cards are **unresolved**: the predictor
must guess, and the guess is priced at *fair odds*, i.e. the payoff on such a
card has zero mean.

This file develops the minimal probabilistic infrastructure needed to state and
prove the headline principle

> `E[total payoff] = (number of resolved cards)`,

namely a uniform-expectation functional `E` on a finite sample space, its
linearity, and the **splitting theorem** `expected_total_eq_certain_count`.

The point of stating the splitting theorem for an *arbitrary* finite index type
`ι` and an *arbitrary* subset `K : Finset ι` of resolved cards is that the deck
models of `PermCount.lean` and `DeckGame.lean` are then genuine instances rather
than re-proofs.

## Main results

* `E_sum` — linearity of uniform expectation over a `Finset` sum.
* `expected_total_eq_certain_count` — if every card of `K` pays a deterministic
  `1` and every card outside `K` is fair, the expected total payoff is `K.card`.
* `expected_total_eq_certain_sum` — the weighted version with arbitrary
  deterministic payoffs on `K`.
* `no_fair_portfolio_edge` — a portfolio consisting only of fair cards has zero
  expected payoff, *whatever* the (possibly wildly correlated) joint law.

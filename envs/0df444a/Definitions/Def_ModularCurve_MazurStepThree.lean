-- title:
--   Mazur's Step Three as a named proposition
-- statement:
--   This module introduces a single Prop-valued definition, [`MazurStepThree p`](../def/ModularCurve_MazurStepThree.html#L8), indexed by a natural number $p$; nothing is proved here. Unfolded, [`MazurStepThree p`](../def/ModularCurve_MazurStepThree.html#L8) asserts: suppose $p$ is prime and $p \notin \{2,3,5,7,13\}$; let $W$ be a Weierstrass curve over $\mathbb Z$ with $\Delta \neq 0$ satisfying the semistability condition that no prime $q$ dividing $\Delta$ divides $c_4$; let $Q$ be a point of $W$ base-changed along $\mathbb Z \to \mathbb Q$ and then to $\overline{\mathbb Q}$ (the algebraic closure `AlgebraicClosure ℚ`), fixed by every $\mathbb Q$-algebra automorphism of $\overline{\mathbb Q}$ and of exact additive order $p$. Assume further that $2 \mid \Delta$ and $Q$ fails `W.InZeroComponentAt A` for every valuation subring $A \subseteq \overline{\mathbb Q}$ with $2$ a nonunit of $A$, and likewise that $3 \mid \Delta$ with $Q$ off the zero component at every valuation subring over $3$. The conclusion is that for every prime $\ell \notin \{2,3,p\}$ dividing $\Delta$ and every valuation subring $A$ of $\overline{\mathbb Q}$ with $\ell$ a nonunit (the predicate [`ValuationSubring.LiesOverPrime`](../def/FLTPrelim_Ramification.html#L16)), $Q$ again fails `W.InZeroComponentAt A`.
--
--   Here `W.InZeroComponentAt A P` holds when $P = 0$, or $P = (x,y)$ with either $x \notin A$, or $x, y \in A$ and the images of $x,y$ in the residue field of $A$ give a nonsingular point of $W$ reduced to that residue field. Thus membership in the "zero component" is a condition on the chosen integral model $W$ and on the valuation subring, expressed by reduction into the smooth locus, not via a Néron model. The behaviour of $Q$ at $2$ and at $3$ is assumed rather than derived, so the statement is counting-free at those primes.
--
--   **Relation to Mathlib.** Mathlib supplies Weierstrass curves, their affine points, valuation subrings and residue fields; the predicates [`WeierstrassCurve.InZeroComponentAt`](../def/EllipticCurve_ZeroComponentAt.html#L13) and [`ValuationSubring.LiesOverPrime`](../def/FLTPrelim_Ramification.html#L16), as well as the action of $\overline{\mathbb Q} \simeq_{\mathbb Q} \overline{\mathbb Q}$ on points used to express Galois-fixedness, are the project's own.
--
--   **Where it is used.** The proposition packages the input from Mazur's work needed along the route: for a semistable integral model with a rational point of prime order $p \notin \{2,3,5,7,13\}$, nontrivial behaviour at the bad primes $2$ and $3$ propagates to all other bad primes away from $p$. It is stated as a named Prop so that it can be established from further named inputs and then applied in the analysis of the Frey curve's $p$-torsion.

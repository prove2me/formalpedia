/-! # The full Shor state is exponentially entangled: Schmidt rank exactly `r`

The state produced by the modular-exponentiation stage of Shor's algorithm is

`|ψ⟩ = Q^{-1/2} ∑_{x < Q} |x⟩ |a^x mod N⟩`,

with `Q` the size of the exponent register and `r = ord_N(a)`.  This file
computes *exactly* the entanglement data of `|ψ⟩` across the register cut,
under the only structural hypothesis that matters:

`HasExactPeriod r F : F x = F y ↔ x ≡ y (mod r)`,

which holds for `F x = a^x` with `r = orderOf a` (`hasExactPeriod_powFun`).

Main results (for `Q = r * m`, `0 < r`, `0 < m`):

* `schmidtRank_shorState` : the Schmidt rank across the cut is **exactly `r`**;
* `normalized_shorState` : the state is a unit vector;
* `entanglementEntropy_shorState` : `S = log r` — the maximum compatible with
  the rank, i.e. the Schmidt spectrum is *flat* (`flatSchmidtSpectrum_shorState`);
* `mutualInformation_shorState` : `I(A:B) = 2 log r`;
* `bondDim_shorState_ge` / `not_hasBondDim_shorState` : every MPS / tensor-train
  representation across the cut needs bond dimension `≥ r`, so no
  `poly(log N)`-bond-dimension emulation of the state exists unless `r` is
  itself polynomially small.

The last item is the precise obstruction to the "tensor-train QFT emulation"
proposal: its low-rank precondition already fails at the *input* of the QFT.

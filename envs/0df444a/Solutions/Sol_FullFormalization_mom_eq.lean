  FullFormalization.Coefficients

  Source: `auditable_full_proof_nag_and_five_algorithm_cn.md`, sections 4 and 5.

  All scalar coefficient sequences of the rational-momentum Nesterov
  certificate, transcribed verbatim from the source:

    (4.1)  d_j = j (j+7) / 8
    (4.2)  tau = 1/(2 (2 d_N + 1)) = 2 / (N^2 + 7 N + 4)
    (4.3)  h_j = (j+2)/2 - j(j+1)(j+2) / (2 (N+1)(N+2))
    (4.4)  H_j = (j+1)(j+4)/4 - j(j+1)(j+2)(j+3) / (8 (N+1)(N+2))
    (4.7)  D_0 = 2 d_N + 1
    (4.8)  D_j = 2 d_N - d_{j-1}          (1 <= j <= N)
    (4.11) a_j = H_j / D_{j+1}            (0 <= j < N)
    (4.12) a_{-1} = 0,  a_N = 1
    (4.13) b_j = a_j - a_{j-1}            (0 <= j <= N)
    (3.2)  m_k = k / (k+3)

  Representation choices (recorded in DEPENDENCY_MAP.md, section 9, and in
  THEOREM_AUDIT.md):

  * Coefficients are real-valued.  Every division below is a division in the
    exact characteristic-zero field `R`; no floating point arithmetic and no
    finite enumeration is used anywhere.  All identities in
    `CoefficientIdentities.lean` are proved symbolically in `N` and `j`.

  * `D` is defined by the source's two-case definition: index `0` uses the
    separately-declared `D_0`, and the source explicitly warns (line 427) that
    formula (4.8) must not be extended mechanically to `j = 0`.  The Lean
    definition reproduces exactly that two-case split.

  * `a` uses the source's separate endpoint values: `a_N = 1` is *not* equal to
    `H_N / D_{N+1}`, so it is a genuine case split, not a convenience.

  * `a_{-1} = 0` is not an index of `a : Nat -> R`; it is absorbed into the
    definition of `b`, where `b_0 := a_0 - a_{-1} = a_0`.

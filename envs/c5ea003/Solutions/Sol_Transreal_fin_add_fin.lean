# The four-constructor transreal carrier and its arithmetic

This file introduces the carrier used throughout the *guarded transfer principle*
development: the **transreals**, a four-constructor extension of `ℝ` by two
signed infinities and one exceptional element `null` (Anderson's *nullity* `Φ`).

```
Transreal ::= fin ℝ | pinf | ninf | null
```

Arithmetic is total: every pair of transreals has a sum, a product and a
quotient.  Totality is bought by the exceptional constructor, which absorbs all
the indeterminate forms `∞ - ∞`, `0 · ∞` and `0 / 0`.

The mathematical content of this file is the *exact conservativity* of the
finite fragment: `fin : ℝ → Transreal` is an injection that transports `+`, `*`,
`-` verbatim, and transports `/` verbatim **exactly when the denominator is
nonzero**.  At a vanishing denominator the value leaves the finite fragment, and
*which* exceptional constructor it lands on is dictated by the sign of the
numerator (`Transreal.div_fin_zero`).  That trichotomy is the sharp boundary
exploited by `Cryptography.Transreal.Topology` and
`Cryptography.Transreal.Transfer`.

/-! ### Reciprocal and division

The reciprocal of `0` is `pinf`; the reciprocal of either infinity is `0`.
Division is defined, as usual, as multiplication by the reciprocal.  The
resulting behaviour at a vanishing denominator is the trichotomy
`x / 0 = pinf, ninf, null` according as `x > 0`, `x < 0`, `x = 0`. -/

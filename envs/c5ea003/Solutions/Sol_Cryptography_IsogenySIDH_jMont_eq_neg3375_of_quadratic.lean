# Radical 2-isogeny walks do not backtrack on the `j`-line

`RadicalWalkStructure` proved a *one-step* non-backtracking statement at the
level of kernels: the kernel of the next radical step is the image of a
four-torsion point, while the dual kernel is the image of the non-kernel
two-torsion, and these are distinct.  That leaves open the sharper, genuinely
*global* question, which is the one that matters for the mixing behaviour of a
radical walk:

> can a radical walk return to its starting point of the `j`-line after two
> steps, i.e. can `j_{n+2} = j_n`?

This file settles it completely, with no unproved side conditions.

The computation is carried out along the following chain.

* `jQuot_radTwoParam` — the second step's target, as a rational function of the
  *original* parameter:
  `jQuot (radTwoParam A α) = 4 (A² + 60A + 132)³ / ((A+2)(A-2)⁴)`.
  As in `ModularTwoIsogeny`, the radical `α` cancels.
* `two_step_return_iff` — consequently `j_{n+2} = j_n` happens **iff** the two
  explicit polynomials `btNum A = A² + 60A + 132` and
  `btDen A = 4(A²-3)(A-2)` have equal cubes.
* `backtrackPoly_factor` — `btNum³ - btDen³` factors as
  `-(A-6)(4A² + 15A + 18) · (btNum² + btNum·btDen + btDen²)`, the first factor
  being the "principal" branch and the second the branch that needs a
  primitive cube root of unity.
* `jMont_six` (`= 287496`), `jMont_eq_neg3375_of_quadratic` (`= -3375`) and
  `sq_eq_three_of_btDen_eq_zero` (`j = 0`) identify the three exceptional
  `j`-invariants: `287496` (CM by discriminant `-16`), `-3375` (discriminant
  `-7`) and `0` (discriminant `-3`).
* `radical_two_step_backtracking_classification` and the `j`-level corollary
  `radical_two_step_nonbacktracking` — over a field containing no primitive
  cube root of unity, a radical step can backtrack **only** at
  `j ∈ {0, -3375, 287496}`.
* `radChain_two_step_nonbacktracking` — the walk version.
* `backtracking_locus_card_le_nine` — over *any* field (in particular over
  `𝔽_{p²}`, which does contain cube roots of unity) the backtracking locus is
  cut out by a degree-9 polynomial with nonzero leading coefficient `-64`, so
  at most nine Montgomery parameters per field can backtrack.

Together with the results of `RadicalWalkStructure` this closes Conjecture 4 of
the previous cycle's `FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md` in the two-step case, and pins down
exactly which `j`-invariants the conjectured exceptional set must contain: the
guess `{1728, 8000, -3375, 287496}` was wrong in detail — the correct list for
two-step returns is `{0, -3375, 287496}`, while `{1728, 8000, -3375}` is the
list for one-step returns proved in `RadicalWalkStructure`.

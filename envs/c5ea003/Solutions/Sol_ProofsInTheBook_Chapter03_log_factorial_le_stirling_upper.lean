# Chapter 3: Binomial coefficients are (almost) never powers

From "Proofs from THE BOOK" (Aigner & Ziegler).

## Book content summary

The book states Sylvester's theorem (1892):

> If n ≥ 2k, then at least one of the numbers n, n - 1, ..., n - k + 1
> has a prime divisor p greater than k.

Equivalently, the binomial coefficient C(n,k) = n(n-1)...(n-k+1)/k!
always has a prime factor p > k when n ≥ 2k.

The central case n = 2k is precisely Bertrand's postulate (Chapter 2).

For the general case, the book notes (p. 13):

> In 1934, Erdős gave a short and elementary Book Proof of Sylvester's
> result, running along the lines of his proof of Bertrand's postulate.

The book does **not** reproduce this proof in full. It references:

> P. Erdős: A theorem of Sylvester and Schur,
> J. London Math. Soc. 9 (1934), 282-288.

The rest of Chapter 3 uses Sylvester's theorem as a lemma to prove the
"binomial coefficients are almost never powers" result.

## Formalization status

The central case (C(2k,k)) is fully proved below using Bertrand's postulate.

The general case (`sylvester_general`) currently takes `hsmooth` (that
n.descFactorial k is not (k+1)-smooth) as a premise. Eliminating this
premise requires a full formalization of Erdős's 1934 Sylvester-Schur
proof, which uses a refined analysis of how prime powers are distributed
among the k consecutive integers — more delicate than the Bertrand
chapter's global inequality bounding.

This is tracked in TODO.md as "Ch03: Sylvester smoothness core" —
difficulty: Medium-Hard, blocker: needs Erdős 1934 proof formalized.

### Central case of Sylvester's theorem

For the central binomial coefficient C(2k,k), we can give a clean proof
using Bertrand's postulate (Chapter 2):
- By Bertrand, ∃ prime p with k < p ≤ 2k.
- p divides (2k)! since p ≤ 2k.
- p does not divide k! since p > k.
- Since C(2k,k) · (k!)² = (2k)!, Euclid's lemma gives p | C(2k,k).

### General Sylvester's theorem

For n ≥ 2k, the book extends the argument to C(n,k) by analyzing the
product n(n-1)···(n-k+1) = k! · C(n,k). For each of the k consecutive
integers n-j (0 ≤ j ≤ k-1), decompose n-j = q_j · r_j where q_j is
k-smooth and r_j has only prime factors > k. The q_j are bounded by
the prime factorization structure, forcing some r_j > 1.

### Binomial coefficients are (almost) never powers

Erdős's theorem (1951): C(n,k) ≠ m^l for k ≥ 4, n ≥ 2k, l ≥ 2.
Reference: P. Erdős, On a diophantine equation,
J. London Math. Soc. 26 (1951), 176-178.

Below: Step 1 (concentration lemma + n > k²) is complete.
Steps 2–4 are pending (l-th-power-free decomposition, distinctness,
classification {aⱼ}={1,…,k}, and contradiction for l=2, l≥3).

-- title:
--   Euler count and face-boundary lengths from a planar drawing
-- statement:
--   For a finite connected simple graph with at least three vertices and a crossing-free drawing, the face boundary walks can be listed so their number satisfies Euler’s formula, their lengths sum to twice the number of edges, and every boundary walk has length at least three. This packages the needed planar topology and the exclusion of one- and two-edge face boundaries under the stated hypotheses.

Bounded tree-width of the pieces: Robertson–Seymour (planar graphs of radius r have tree-width at most 3r+1) / Bodlaender (k-outerplanar graphs have tree-width at most 3k-1).

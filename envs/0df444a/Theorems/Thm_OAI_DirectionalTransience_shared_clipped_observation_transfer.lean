--   OAI.DirectionalTransience.shared_clipped_observation_transfer: intermediate lemma from OpenAI, Directional transience implies ballisticity
-- statement:
--   An intermediate lemma of the split of OpenAI's proof of `OAI.DirectionalTransience.directional_transience_implies_ballisticity`, carved from OpenAI's openai/math development for this platform. The statement and its proof are OpenAI's (OpenAI, *Directional transience implies ballisticity*, OpenAI Math Release, September 23, 2026, result family 220, [github.com/openai/math](https://github.com/openai/math), Apache License 2.0); in Lean it is the declaration `OAI.DirectionalTransience.shared_clipped_observation_transfer` of [lean/OAI/Probability/Ballisticity/Estimates/ClippedAbsThreeHalves.lean](https://github.com/openai/math/blob/adc7f1241b42e322a6451854ab7e4b4c146bf78a/lean/OAI/Probability/Ballisticity/Estimates/ClippedAbsThreeHalves.lean) at commit adc7f12, ported to Lean 4.33.1 and Mathlib 0df444a.

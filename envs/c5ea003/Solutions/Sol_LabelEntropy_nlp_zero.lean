# Entropy deficit of a label coarsening

## Context (FACT round-29 #2, "THE-ORIGINAL-STANDS")

The audit of paper 99's rebuild turned on a purely information-theoretic fact:
merging distinct labels can only *destroy* label entropy, never create it, and
the amount destroyed is controlled by a nonnegative **deficit** functional.

This file develops that functional from scratch (Mathlib has no Shannon entropy
for finitely supported weight functions), in bits, with the standard convention
`0 · log 0 = 0` — which is automatic in Lean because `Real.logb 2 0 = 0`.

Main results:

* `D_eq` — closed form of the deficit `D s w = ∑ w x · (log₂ W − log₂ (w x))`;
* `D_nonneg` — the deficit of a nonnegative weight vector is `≥ 0`
  (equivalently: `nlp (∑ w) ≤ H w`, i.e. *merging a block loses entropy*);
* `kl_nonneg` — Gibbs' inequality in unnormalised form, with the zero
  convention and an explicit absolute-continuity hypothesis (which is
  **necessary**: see `kl_neg_without_absolute_continuity`);
* `D_superadditive` — concavity of entropy in deficit form: the total deficit
  of a family of weight vectors is at most the deficit of their sum.  This is
  the engine of the data-processing inequality proved in
  `Applications.JointLabelReconciliation`;
* `D_pos_of_two_positive` — a *strict* loss: whenever a merged block contains
  two strictly positive masses, entropy strictly drops.

# Complementary products of monomial symmetric functions

This file develops, from scratch inside `MvPolynomial (Fin N) R`, the theory needed to
attack the *componentwise splitting independence* phenomenon studied in the paper
"Kleber's conjecture and complementary products of symmetric functions":

> for a partition `θ`, the products `s_α s_β` are linearly independent as `{α, β}` ranges
> over unordered pairs of partitions with `α + β = θ`,

together with its stated analogue for **monomial** symmetric functions over fields of
characteristic zero and over `ℤ`.

Mathlib has no ring of symmetric functions and no Schur functions, so everything here is
built by hand.  We work with *monomial symmetric polynomials* `msym R d`, the sum of all
distinct permutations of a monomial `x^d` in `N` variables; these are exactly the monomial
symmetric functions `m_λ` when `N` is at least the number of parts involved.

## Main results

* `KleberSplit.linearIndependent_msym_mul`: if `{α_i, β_i}` is a finite family of pairs of
  exponent vectors whose *multiset unions* `parts α_i + parts β_i` are pairwise distinct
  (and which fit into `N` variables), then the products `m_{α_i} m_{β_i}` are linearly
  independent over any characteristic-zero domain (in particular over `ℤ` and over any
  field of characteristic zero).
* `KleberSplit.linearIndependent_msym_complementary`: the specialisation to
  componentwise splittings `α_i + β_i = θ` of a fixed `θ`.
* `KleberSplit.linearIndependent_msym`: the monomial symmetric polynomials themselves are
  linearly independent (the case `β = 0`).
* `KleberSplit.linearIndependent_kleber_complementary`: the Kleber-style form, for
  complementary pairs `(λ, ρ - λ)` inside a fixed shape `ρ` (e.g. a rectangle), where the
  hypothesis that the variables suffice is derived rather than assumed.
* `KleberSplit.linearIndependent_row_splittings`: the full one-row case
  `θ = (n)`: the products `m_{(k)} m_{(n-k)}`, `2 * k ≤ n`, are linearly independent.
* `KleberSplit.parts_union_eq_of_msym_mul_eq`: a product `m_α m_β` determines the multiset
  union `parts α + parts β`.
* `KleberSplit.not_linearIndependent_of_too_few_variables` and
  `KleberSplit.linearIndependent_collision_pair_two` (with its special case
  `KleberSplit.linearIndependent_collision_pair`): the two hypotheses are, respectively,
  necessary and not necessary.

The generalisation to products of arbitrarily many factors is in
`Algebra.KleberManyFoldProducts`.

## The mechanism

The Schur-function proof cannot use the dominance-leading term of `s_α s_β`, since every
splitting of `θ` has the *same* leading term `s_θ`.  The mechanism isolated here is the
opposite end of the expansion, controlled by the quadratic statistic
`Qstat d = ∑ i, (d i)^2`:

* `Qstat (u + v) = Qstat u + Qstat v + 2 * dotp u v` (`Qstat_add`), so any monomial
  occurring in `m_α m_β` has `Qstat` **at least** `Qstat α + Qstat β`;
* equality holds exactly when the two exponent vectors have disjoint supports
  (`dotp_eq_zero_iff`), in which case the resulting monomial has part multiset
  `parts α + parts β`, the multiset union.

So the `Qstat`-minimal monomials of `m_α m_β` remember precisely the multiset union of
`α` and `β`, which yields a genuine (non-dominance) triangularity argument.

## Boundary

The hypothesis that the unions are distinct is *not* automatic for componentwise
splittings: `KleberSplit.union_collision_five_three` exhibits two distinct splittings of
`θ = (5,3)` with the same union.  This is exactly the obstruction that makes the full
theorem of the paper hard, and it is recorded here honestly rather than hidden.

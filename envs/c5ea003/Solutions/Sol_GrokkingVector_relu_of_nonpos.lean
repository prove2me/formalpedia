# Delayed margin positivity for vector-valued two-layer ReLU networks

The catalog file `Catalog/MachineLearning/GrokkingPhaseTransition.lean` treats a
width-one *scalar* network.  This file carries out Future Direction 1 (finite
hidden width, matrix weights, a finite test set, and a classification margin)
and Direction 3 (train/test separation).

Main results.

* `exists_sharp_threshold`: any monotone continuous signal that starts negative
  and is eventually positive has a *sharp* threshold `τ`: it is `≤ 0` on
  `(-∞, τ]` and `> 0` on `(τ, ∞)`.  The threshold is unique
  (`sharp_threshold_unique`).
* `margin_sharp_threshold`: the same holds for the *minimum* over a finite test
  set of finitely many such signals — the delayed transition survives taking a
  worst-case margin over a test set.
* `netMargin_delayed_positivity`: for a genuinely vector-valued two-layer ReLU
  network (hidden width `m`, input dimension `d`, matrix weights, negative
  output bias, a finite two-class test set) the classification margin is
  nonpositive up to an explicit delay and strictly positive afterwards.
* `grokking_window_eq`: for a concrete dataset the set of times at which the
  training set is already perfectly classified while the test point is still
  misclassified is *exactly* the interval `(1/2, 2]` — a formal train/test
  separation window.

The general theorem `netMargin_delayed_positivity` is not vacuous: here is a
two-class test set on which all of its hypotheses hold, and for which the sharp
margin threshold can be computed exactly (it equals `1`).

# Quantitative delay bounds, convex (tropical) structure, and robustness

Second research cycle.  `VectorMargin.lean` proves that the worst-case margin of
a vector-valued two-layer ReLU network has a *sharp* delay `τ`.  Here we

* locate `τ` quantitatively: `delay_lower_bound_of_threshold` and
  `delay_upper_bound_of_threshold` sandwich the delay between `|c| / S`, where
  `S = ∑ⱼ aⱼ gⱼ` is the total signal of the point, and
  `(|c|/a_{j₀} - b_{j₀})/g_{j₀}` coming from any single active unit — so the
  delay scales like *output-bias magnitude divided by signal strength*;
* connect the delay to the *tropical / convex-geometric* picture of the catalog
  file `Catalog/Tropical/NeuralCoding/GrokPhaseTransition.lean`: the ramped
  network output is a convex piecewise-linear (tropical) function of the ramp
  parameter (`netRamp_convexOn`), hence the set of times at which the network
  still fails is always an interval (`failure_set_convex`) — the delayed
  transition can never happen twice;
* prove robustness of the delayed transition itself
  (`perturbed_delayed_transition`): a uniformly `ε`-close trajectory keeps the
  transition, with the threshold moving by at most `ε/κ` where `κ` is the growth
  rate after the threshold;
* prove that the ratio between test delay and train delay is unbounded
  (`grokking_ratio_unbounded`): weakening the test signal makes the grokking
  window arbitrarily long compared with the time to fit the training set.

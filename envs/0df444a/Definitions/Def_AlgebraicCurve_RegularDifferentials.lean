-- title:
--   Everywhere-regular Kähler differentials of a function field
-- statement:
--   Throughout, $K$ and $F$ are fields with $F$ a $K$-algebra, and a place of $F/K$ is an element of the project's structure `Place K F`: a valuation subring $\mathcal O_v \subseteq F$ containing the image of $K$, different from $F$ itself, and whose ideals are principal (so $\mathcal O_v$ is a discrete valuation ring, with associated order function $v.\mathrm{ord} : F \to \mathbb Z$ normalised so that an irreducible element has order $1$). For such a $v$, `v.dCoord` is the Kähler differential $d\pi \in \Omega[F\!\mid\!K]$ of a chosen irreducible element $\pi$ of $\mathcal O_v$.
--
--   The module defines [`AlgebraicCurve.regularDifferentials K F`](../def/AlgebraicCurve_RegularDifferentials.html#L26), a $K$-submodule of $\Omega[F\!\mid\!K]$, whose elements are those $\omega$ such that for every place $v$ of $F/K$ there is $f \in \mathcal O_v$ with $\omega = f \cdot v.\mathrm{dCoord}$. Thus $\omega$ is required to be an $\mathcal O_v$-multiple of the differential of a uniformizer at each place simultaneously; when `v.dCoord` generates $\Omega[F\!\mid\!K]$ as an $F$-module, this is the condition $\mathrm{ord}_v \omega \ge 0$. That this set is a $K$-submodule uses only that $\mathcal O_v$ is a subring containing $\mathrm{im}(K \to F)$. The companion lemma [`AlgebraicCurve.mem_regularDifferentials_iff`](../def/AlgebraicCurve_RegularDifferentials.html#L39) records the membership criterion in exactly this form.
--
--   The module also proves [`AlgebraicCurve.Place.exists_ord_eq_one_and_dCoord_eq`](../def/AlgebraicCurve_RegularDifferentials.html#L18): for each place $v$ there is $\pi \in F$ with $v.\mathrm{ord}\,\pi = 1$ and $v.\mathrm{dCoord} = d\pi$. This exposes, without reference to the internal choice made in defining `dCoord`, that `dCoord` is the differential of some element of order exactly one at $v$.
--
--   No statement is made here about the dimension of `regularDifferentials K F`, about Hecke operators, or about $q$-expansions.
--
--   **Relation to Mathlib.** Built on Mathlib's `KaehlerDifferential` module $\Omega[F\!\mid\!K]$ and on Mathlib's theory of valuation subrings and discrete valuation rings, but the notion of a place of $F/K$ and this submodule of everywhere-regular differentials are the project's own, defined in its own `AlgebraicCurve` namespace.
--
--   **Where it is used.** For $F$ the function field of a curve over $K$, this submodule is the space of global regular differentials, which for modular curves is the space attached to weight-two cusp forms and the cotangent space of the Jacobian; it sits alongside the project's divisor, degree and Picard-group constructions for such function fields, which underlie the treatment of Jacobians of modular curves.

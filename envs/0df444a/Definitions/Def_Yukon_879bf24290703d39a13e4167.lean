# ε-Cell First-Fire Bound

This file develops the *first-fire bound* for a hidden value drawn from an arbitrary sampler
`oa : ProbComp R` whose every outcome has probability at most `ε`. Where the uniform development
(`FirstFire.lean`) charges a state-dependent `1 / (|R| - S.card)` per genuine read and needs an
exact telescope to fold the growing exclusion sets, the ε-development charges a single uniform `ε`
per read, valid in *every* state. The first-fire telescope collapses to a plain union bound: an
adaptive `q`-read strategy fires with probability at most `q · ε`.

## The model

A hidden target `w ← oa` is drawn **once** and committed into the run's state; an adaptive
`q`-read strategy `σ : List Bool → R`, mapping the boolean reply history (hit/miss) to the next
read point, then probes that fixed `w`, firing as soon as some read equals `w`. Up to the first
hit the read points are fixed by the all-miss history and independent of `w`, so averaging over
the single hidden draw — without ever conditioning on the drawn value — bounds the firing
probability by the union of `q` fixed singletons, each of mass at most `ε`. This models an eager
run that commits a sampled key at draw time and exposes it only through later membership tests.
Because the per-outcome bound `∀ r, Pr[= r | oa] ≤ ε` holds unconditionally, the bound is valid
in every state.

## Main results

* `hiddenReadMany` / `probEvent_hiddenReadMany_le` : the single-target adaptive read game and its
  first-fire union bound `Pr[fire] ≤ q · ε`.
* `hiddenReadList` / `probEvent_hiddenReadList_le` : the per-attempt-fresh-target list game and
  its union bound.
* `probEvent_bind_fire_le_of_gen` : the deferred-sampling fire bound whose marginal is a
  hidden-target read, against an opaque continuation.
* `drawList` : the explicit i.i.d. front-tape form of the per-attempt draws.

/-! ## Hidden-target adaptive first-fire bound

`hiddenReadMany` draws a single hidden target `w ← oa` **once** and lets an adaptive `q`-read
strategy probe that *fixed* `w` repeatedly. This is the structure of an eager run that commits a
sampled key into its state at draw time and then exposes it only through later membership tests:
the key's value is hidden until the first hit, so up to the first hit the read points are fixed
(determined by the all-miss reply history) and independent of `w`. Averaging over the single hidden
draw — without ever conditioning on the drawn value — gives the union bound `q · ε`. -/

/-- Adaptive `q`-read game against a FIXED hidden target `w`: the strategy `σ` maps the list of
boolean replies (hit/miss) seen so far to the next read point, and the game fires (returns `true`)
iff some read equals `w`. The target `w` is reused across all reads; it is drawn once, outside this
program (see `hiddenReadMany`). -/

hidden target `w` equals one of the `q` read points reached along the all-miss history

every reply is a miss, so the history is `replicate j false`), which is exactly what turns the
averaged firing probability into a plain union bound. -/

/-! ## Averaging the key count and the run-factorization bridge

The multi-key bound `probEvent_hiddenReadList_le` is stated for a *fixed* number of keys `n`. In
the intended application the key count is itself random (one ghost key is drawn per *rejected*
signing attempt), so the closing step averages the bound over a key-count distribution
`kn : ProbComp ℕ`, yielding `E[n] · q · ε`. The final bridge
`probEvent_le_of_eq_bind_hiddenReadList`
packages the union-bound side of the *direct route*: once a run's bad marginal is exhibited as a
`kn >>= hiddenReadList oa q σ` game (the deferred-sampling factorization), the bound is immediate.
-/

/-- **Averaged multi-key hidden-target bound.** When the number of independently drawn hidden keys
is itself sampled from `kn : ProbComp ℕ`, the firing probability of the multi-key game is at most
`E[n] · q · ε`, where `E[n] = ∑' n, Pr[= n | kn] · n` is the expected key count. This is the
averaging step (`C3`) of the direct route: it folds the fixed-`n` bound
`probEvent_hiddenReadList_le` against the key-count distribution. Combined with an expected-count
bound `E[n] ≤ qS / (1 - p)` it gives the target `qS · q · ε / (1 - p)`. -/
theorem probEvent_bind_hiddenReadList_le {oa : ProbComp R} {ε : ℝ≥0∞}
    (hε : ∀ r : R, Pr[= r | oa] ≤ ε) (q : ℕ) (σ : List Bool → R) (kn : ProbComp ℕ) :

/-- **Direct-route union-bound bridge.** If an arbitrary run `run : ProbComp β` with a bad
event `bad : β → Prop` has its bad marginal exhibited as the averaged multi-key hidden-target game
`kn >>= hiddenReadList oa q σ` — i.e. the deferred-sampling factorization that pulls the run's
hidden key draws into an independent front block, reading each off as a `hiddenReadMany` target
probed by the `q` subsequent adaptive reads — then the run's bad probability is bounded by the
expected-count union bound `E[n] · q · ε`.

This is the reusable closing lemma of the direct route: the entire remaining content is supplied as
the hypothesis `hfac`, the distributional equality between the run's bad indicator and the abstract
game. Establishing `hfac` is the deferred-sampling commutation (factoring the run's per-key draws to
the front so the pre-first-hit reads become the deterministic strategy `σ`); the union-bound side it
feeds into is fully discharged here via `probEvent_bind_hiddenReadList_le`. -/

/-! ## Single output-irrelevant draw deferral

The lemmas above take the read strategy `σ` (and, in `hiddenReadList`, the key count) as already
*extracted* data. The genuine new content of the sound route is the **deferral primitive**: lifting
a single hidden draw out of an arbitrary run when that draw is used *only output-irrelevantly* —
i.e. it influences neither the run's visible output nor the read points, only the boolean "fire"
flag computed by membership tests against an adaptive read sequence.

The key observation (cf. `ghostHybridImpl_proj_trans`: the ghost cache is a per-step deterministic
projection of the single ghost-blind run, and the read answer is independent of the ghost value) is
that such a draw can be *deferred* past its continuation. Concretely, a run `oa >>= k` whose
continuation `k w` is built from a `w`-free generator `gen` (producing both the visible output and
the read strategy) with `w` entering only through `readMany w q σ`, has its fire-marginal equal to
that of the deferred game `gen >>= fun p => oa >>= fun w => …`. Each generated branch is then a
`hiddenReadMany` game on a *fixed* strategy `p.2`, charged `q · ε` by
`probEvent_hiddenReadMany_le`. This converts "front-load the draw across the opaque continuation"
into a local `bind`-commutation, the tractable route. -/

/-- **Bind-commutation for an output-irrelevant draw.** When the continuation `k w` is `gen >>= fun
p => pure (p.1, readMany w q p.2)` — a `w`-free generator `gen` producing both the visible output
`p.1` and the read strategy `p.2`, with the hidden draw `w` entering only through the fixed read
game `readMany w q p.2` — the fire-marginal of the run `oa >>= k` is unchanged by deferring the
draw of `w` to *after* `gen`. This is the local deferral step that replaces the abstract
"front-load across the fold" with a `PMF.bind`-commutation, proved here directly at the
`probEvent` level via `ENNReal.tsum_comm`. -/

/-- **Single output-irrelevant draw first-fire bound (structural form).** A run `oa >>= k` that

This is the reusable single-draw deferral primitive of the sound route. It formalizes

/-- **Single output-irrelevant draw first-fire bound (marginal form).** The convenience special
case of `probEvent_bind_fire_le_of_gen` for a run `oa >>= k` whose continuation's fire-marginal is,
for *every* hidden value `w`, exactly that of the fixed read game `readMany w q σ` against a single
strategy `σ` independent of `w`. Whenever every outcome of `oa` has mass at most `ε`, the run fires
with probability at most `q · ε`.

Use this form when the deferred read strategy is a *fixed* `σ` (the simplest output-irrelevant
case); use the structural `probEvent_bind_fire_le_of_gen` when the strategy is itself produced by
`w`-free randomness. -/

/-! ## Iterated draws: the explicit front-block key list

Stage A defers a *single* output-irrelevant draw. `drawList` lifts this to `n` interleaved draws
by collecting them into an explicit front block: draw a list of `n` independent keys up front,
against which a run's hidden draws can be exhibited and then charged by the abstract
`hiddenReadList` union bound. -/

factorization). The keys are the hidden targets; the list length is the key count `n`. -/

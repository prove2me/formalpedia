# Kitchen query complexity: cooking, tasting, and an unconditional `P ≠ NP` in the kitchen

The slogan "a recipe is an algorithm, so `C(R)` versus `V(R)` is `P` versus `NP`" is
usually left as a metaphor.  This file makes the metaphor into a theorem by choosing a
computational model in which the separation is *provable*: the deterministic
**decision-tree (query) model**.

* A *pantry* of `n` ingredients is a Boolean vector `x : Fin n → Bool` (each ingredient is
  fresh/spoiled, whipped/flat, ...).
* A *dish* is a predicate `f : Pantry n → Bool`: is the result good?
* *Cooking* means touching all `n` ingredients: `C(R) = n`.
* *Tasting* is modelled by a `Taste` tree: adaptively probe individual ingredients of the
  finished dish and then declare it good or bad.  `V(R)` is the minimal depth of a taste
  tree computing `f` (`tasteCost`).
* *Nondeterministic verification* (a "garnish" pointing at what to taste) is certificate
  complexity: a set `S` of probes with `IsCertificate f x S`.

The main results are:

* `Taste.card_path_le_depth`, `Taste.eval_eq_of_agree`: the path lemma, the technical
  heart of every lower bound below.
* `sensitivity_le_tasteCost`: sensitivity is a lower bound on tasting time.
* `tasteCost_le_card_ingredients`: tasting is never slower than cooking, `V(R) ≤ C(R)`.
* `tasteCost_allFresh`: the "everything must be fresh" dish is *evasive*: `V = C = n`.
* `kitchen_P_ne_NP`: the anySpoiled dish has a one-probe nondeterministic certificate at
  every bad pantry, yet every deterministic taster needs all `n` probes.  This is an
  unconditional separation of deterministic and nondeterministic kitchen verification.
* `souffle_no_certificate_shortcut`: for the soufflé dish (parity of the pantry) *even*
  nondeterministic verification is useless — every certificate at every pantry is the whole
  pantry.  This is the honest version of "soufflé verification is co-NP-hard": the soufflé
  is hard to verify from *both* sides, unlike the salad.
* `tasteCost_zero_iff_constant`: you cannot tell whether the soufflé rose without cutting
  into it.

No claim about Navier–Stokes or `PSPACE` is made: those need a physical model that timing
data does not supply.  What *is* proved is the exact combinatorial shadow of the
conjecture.

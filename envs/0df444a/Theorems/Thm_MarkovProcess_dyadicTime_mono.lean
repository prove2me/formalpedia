# Dyadic chaining on a bounded interval of nonnegative time

This file is deterministic infrastructure for a quantitative modulus of continuity.  It
subdivides the interval `[0, T]` of nonnegative real time into `2 ^ m` equal parts and records
what uniform control of the adjacent increments of a function `f : ℝ≥0 → E` on all subdivisions
from a base level downwards implies for pairs of subdivision points.

Main results:

* `MarkovProcess.dyadicTime`, the `i`-th point of the level-`m` subdivision of `[0, T]`, with its
  monotonicity, refinement and increment estimates;
* `MarkovProcess.HasDyadicAdjacentBound`, the hypothesis that all adjacent increments of `f` on
  the level-`m` subdivision are at most `e`;
* `MarkovProcess.edist_dyadicTime_le_of_hasDyadicAdjacentBound`, the same-level chaining bound;
* `MarkovProcess.edist_dyadicTime_ancestor_le`, the bound from a fine subdivision point to its
  canonical coarse ancestor by the sum of the intervening bounds;
* `MarkovProcess.edist_dyadicTime_le_of_sub_le`, the two-point chaining bound: subdivision points
  of level `n + r` whose indices differ by at most `2 ^ r` are within `2 * (chain sum) + e n`;
* `MarkovProcess.dyadicIndex` and its approximation lemmas, which locate an arbitrary time of
  `[0, T]` between consecutive subdivision points and compare the indices of two nearby times.

Everything here is a statement about a fixed function of time.  No measure, no probability law,
and no continuity of `f` is used or asserted.

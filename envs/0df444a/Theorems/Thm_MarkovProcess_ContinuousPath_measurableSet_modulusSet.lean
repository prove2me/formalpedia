# A quantitative modulus of continuity from a Kolmogorov moment bound

The Kolmogorov--Chentsov argument is usually stated as an almost-sure Hölder property of a
continuous modification.  This file records the *quantitative* form that a tightness argument
needs: for a probability law on continuous paths whose coordinate process satisfies the
Kolmogorov moment condition with exponents `p`, `q` and constant `M`, the mass of the paths that
oscillate by more than `r` at scale `delta` on `[0, T]` is at most `eps`, once `delta` is small
enough --- and the threshold `delta` depends only on `p`, `q`, `M`, the Hölder exponent, `T`,
`r` and `eps`, not on the law.  This uniformity is the whole point: it is what makes the estimate
usable simultaneously at every starting point of a Markov process.

Main results:

* `MarkovProcess.ContinuousPath.modulusSet`, the closed set of paths whose oscillation over
  `[0, T]` at scale `delta` is at most `r`, with `isClosed_modulusSet` and
  `measurableSet_modulusSet`;
* `MarkovProcess.ContinuousPath.exists_measure_compl_modulusSet_le`, the quantitative estimate,
  uniform over all laws obeying one and the same moment bound.

Nothing here constructs a law, asserts a Hölder exponent for individual paths, or claims
tightness; tightness is assembled from this estimate elsewhere.

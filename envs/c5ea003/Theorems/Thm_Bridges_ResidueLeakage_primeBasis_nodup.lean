# Pattern surjectivity of the QR fingerprint, and the failure of individual pinning

Companion file to `Bridges.ResidueLeakageDirichletNoPruning`.

Where the no-pruning theorem shows that the cheap residue channel cannot *remove*
any candidate prime, this file shows the complementary, constructive fact: the
fingerprint map is **surjective onto all `2^K` sign patterns**, already on primes.
The proof is a genuine cross-domain bridge:

* Chinese remainder theorem (`existsCRT`) to build the residue class,
* quadratic reciprocity + the supplementary law at `2` (`jacobiSym.at_two`),
* existence of a quadratic nonresidue in a finite field
  (`FiniteField.exists_nonsquare`),
* Dirichlet's theorem (imported through `infinite_primes_jacobi_eq`).

Main results:

* `exists_prime_jacobi_pattern` — every prescribed sign pattern on a set of
  distinct odd probe primes, together with a prescribed value at `2`, is
  realised by infinitely many primes.
* `qrFingerprint_pattern_surjective` — the same for an arbitrary list of
  distinct probe primes (the prime `2` allowed): all `2^K` fingerprints occur.
* `no_individual_pinning` — for any observed `F_A(N₀)` and any probe prime `a₀`,
  there are consistent factorisations `p₁q₁` and `p₂q₂` of the *same*
  fingerprint with `(a₀|p₁) = 1` and `(a₀|p₂) = -1`: the data pins down no
  individual symbol of a factor, only the symmetric products.

-- title:
--   Reduction of coordinates and points on a minimal Weierstrass curve
-- statement:
--   Throughout, $R$ is a discrete valuation ring that is a domain, $K$ is a field equipped with an $R$-algebra structure making it the fraction field of $R$, and $\mathrm{ResidueField}\,R$ denotes the residue field of $R$.
--
--   [`WeierstrassCurve.reduceCoord R x`](../def/EllipticCurve_PointReduction.html#L17), for $x \in K$, is defined by cases: if some $r \in R$ has $r \mapsto x$ under the structure map $R \to K$, the value is the residue class of such an $r$ in the residue field; otherwise the value is $0$. Since $R \to K$ is injective, the residue class does not depend on the element chosen, so on $R$-integral elements this is the composite $R \to \mathrm{ResidueField}\,R$ transported along $R \cong$ (integral elements of $K$), while non-integral $x$ receive the junk value $0$.
--
--   [`WeierstrassCurve.reducePoint_alt`](../def/EllipticCurve_PointReduction.html#L22) takes a Weierstrass curve $W$ over $K$ together with an instance of Mathlib's minimality predicate `W.IsMinimal R`, and produces a function from the points of the associated affine curve $W$ to the points of the affine curve attached to the reduced curve `W.reduction R` over the residue field. It is defined by cases on the point: the point at infinity goes to the point at infinity; an affine point $(x,y)$ (carrying its nonsingularity witness on $W$) goes to $(\bar x, \bar y) = ($`reduceCoord R x`$,$ `reduceCoord R y`$)$ provided two conditions hold, namely that both valuations $v(x), v(y) \le 1$ for the valuation of $K$ attached to the maximal ideal of $R$ (that is, both coordinates are integral) and that the pair $(\bar x, \bar y)$ is a nonsingular point of the reduced curve; in every remaining case, the value is the point at infinity. Thus points with a non-integral coordinate, and pairs whose reduction is singular, are sent to the point at infinity by fiat. This is a bare function on points: no additivity, kernel or injectivity statement is part of the definition.
--
--   **Relation to Mathlib.** Mathlib supplies the minimality predicate `WeierstrassCurve.IsMinimal`, the reduced curve `WeierstrassCurve.reduction`, and the group of affine points `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point`; the reduction map on points, and the partial section `reduceCoord` of the residue map used to define it, are the project's own.
--
--   **Where it is used.** These definitions provide the reduction map $E(K) \to \tilde E(k)$ at a discrete valuation, in the form used in the modules of the tree that study torsion and its reduction for elliptic curves over local and global fields.

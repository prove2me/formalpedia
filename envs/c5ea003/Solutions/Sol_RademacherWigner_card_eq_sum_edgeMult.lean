# All-order walk expansion of the trace, and the exact vanishing of every odd moment

The files `Probability.WignerRademacherEnsemble` and `Probability.WignerWalkParity`
compute the spectral moments of the symmetric Rademacher ensemble at orders `2`, `3`
and `4`, and isolate the sign-flip involution for a walk of fixed length.  This file
removes the length restriction completely:

* `RademacherWigner.trace_pow_succ_sum_walks` expands `tr (M ^ (m+1))` for an
  *arbitrary* matrix as a sum over closed `(m+1)`-walks, encoded as a starting
  vertex `i` together with the remaining vertices `v : Fin m → Fin N`; the `t`-th
  step goes from `(Fin.cons i v) t` to `(Fin.snoc v i) t`.  This is proved by
  induction from the entrywise path expansion `RademacherWigner.pow_apply_sum_walks`.

* The sign-flip calculus is then developed for an arbitrary finite family of steps
  `a b : ι → Fin N` (`edgeMult`, `prod_entry_flipEdge_family`), giving

  - `expect_prod_entry_family_eq_zero_of_card_odd`: **any** odd-size family of steps
    has vanishing ensemble average, and
  - `prod_entry_eq_one_of_even`: a loop-free family all of whose edge multiplicities
    are even has monomial identically `1`,

  hence the exact dichotomy `expect_prod_entry_family`: the ensemble average of a
  walk monomial is `1` if the walk is loop-free with all edge multiplicities even,
  and `0` otherwise.

* Consequently `expect_trace_pow_eq_sum_indicator` reduces the computation of *every*
  moment `E [tr W^m]` to a purely combinatorial count of even closed walks, and
  `expect_trace_pow_odd` proves that **all odd trace moments vanish exactly, at every
  finite dimension `N` and every odd order** — no asymptotics, no error terms.
  Normalising, `expect_normalizedMoment_odd` matches the odd moments of the
  semicircle law (`WignerUniversal`-style statement at all orders, rather than only
  at order `3`).

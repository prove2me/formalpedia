# Exit times along an exhaustion

For an increasing sequence of open sets `U n` covering the state space (an open exhaustion), the
exit time of a continuous path from `U n` tends to infinity: the path restricted to a compact time
interval has compact range, which lies in some `U N`, and the path therefore stays in `U n` on that
interval for every `n ≥ N` (`tendsto_exitTime_atTop`).  Exit times are monotone in the set
(`exitTime_mono`), as are the truncated exit times.

This is the path-space fact behind nonexplosion arguments: no probability law is involved here.

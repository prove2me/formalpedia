-- title:
--   Pushforward norm formula along a finite separable K-morphism
-- statement:
--   Let $K$, $F$, $F'$ be fields, with $F$ and $F'$ algebras over $K$ and $F$ of characteristic zero, and let $\varphi : F \to F'$ be a $K$-algebra homomorphism. Assume $F'$ has principal divisors over $K$, i.e. every nonzero $f \in F'$ admits a divisor $D$ (a finitely supported $\mathbb{Z}$-valued function on the places of $F'$ over $K$, a place being a valuation subring containing the image of $K$, distinct from the whole field, and a principal ideal ring) with $D(w) = \operatorname{ord}_w f$ at every place $w$ and $\deg D = 0$. Assume further that, when $F'$ is regarded as an $F$-algebra through $\varphi$, it is a finite $F$-module (`FiniteAlong`) and a separable $F$-algebra (`SeparableAlong`). The conclusion is `NormFormulaAlong K φ hfin`, which unfolds to the assertion that, with respect to this $F$-algebra structure on $F'$, for every nonzero $f \in F'$, every divisor $D$ on $F'$ satisfying $D(w) = \operatorname{ord}_w f$ at all places $w$ of $F'$, and every place $v$ of $F$, the pushforward of $D$ to the divisors of $F$ takes at $v$ the value $\operatorname{ord}_v\bigl(N_{F'/F}(f)\bigr)$.

--   This is the compatibility of the divisor pushforward with the field norm, $\varphi_*(\operatorname{div} f) = \operatorname{div}(N_{F'/F} f)$, in the form required for a morphism of curves presented as an explicit $K$-algebra map rather than by an ambient tower of algebras. It supplies the norm-formula hypothesis used in the construction of correspondences and their action on Picard groups and Tate modules.

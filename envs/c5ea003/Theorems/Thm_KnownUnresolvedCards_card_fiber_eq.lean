# Known versus unresolved cards — II. Fibre counting for shuffled decks

The unresolved part of a deck is modelled by a uniformly random bijection
`σ : α ≃ α` between *slots* and *cards*.  A *strategy* is an arbitrary function
`g : α → α` ("in slot `i` I predict card `g i`"); it need not be injective, so a
gambler is allowed to name the same card twice.

Everything about the mean and variance of the score of such a strategy is
controlled by two combinatorial counts:

* `fiber i a`  — permutations with `σ i = a`;
* `fiber₂ i j a b` — permutations with `σ i = a` and `σ j = b`.

We compute both **without ever mentioning a factorial**, using only the
transitivity of the left translation action of transpositions on
`Equiv.Perm α`:

* `card_fiber_mul`  : `|α| * |fiber i a| = |Perm α|`;
* `card_fiber₂_mul` : `(|α| - 1) * |fiber₂ i j a b| = |fiber i a|` for `i ≠ j`, `a ≠ b`.

## Main results

* `card_fiber_eq`, `card_fiber₂_eq` — transposition symmetry of the fibres.
* `card_fiber_mul`, `card_fiber₂_mul` — the two counting identities.
* `sum_hits_eq_card_perm` — **strategy invariance of the mean**: for *every*
  `g : α → α`, `∑ σ, hits g σ = |Perm α|`, i.e. the mean score is exactly `1`.
* `sum_hits_sq_eq_two_mul` — for an *injective* strategy the second moment is
  `2 |Perm α|`.
* `sum_hits_sq_collision` — the second moment of an **arbitrary** strategy,
  governed by its collision profile `distinctCallPairs`.
* `hits_const_eq_one` — a constant strategy scores exactly `1`, deterministically.

-- title:
--   Lemma 4.24: a valid $V2$ certificate of layer $k+1$ reaches everyone
-- statement:
--   Let $k\ge 1$, $f<\frac{2^{k+1}-1}{2^{k+2}-1}n$, $\Delta>0$, and let $E$ be an execution of the $k$-SigT protocol with an $f$-bounded corrupt set $F$ and stabilization time $\mathrm{GST}\ge0$. Suppose no correct party decides in $E$. Then every correct party receives a valid $V2$ certificate of layer $k+1$.
--
--   The hypothesis cannot in fact hold (Claim 4.25 shows this), but the lemma is stated in this form on the page and it is the step of the argument by contradiction that gives termination. It uses Lemma 4.11 to show that a party with an adopt or tally output carries enough proofs to lead views whose certificates are valid in the last layer.

--   Differences from the source:
--   - generalization: “n is such that all fractions we consider are integers” (p.4) → no divisibility hypothesis on n and f; every comparison with a fraction is made in ℤ; reason: the fractions occur only inside inequalities, each step of the proof holds over ℚ, and the printed case is the instance where the fractions are integers
--   - encoding: f < (2^{k+1}−1)n/(2^{k+2}−1) → (2^{k+2}−1)·f < (2^{k+1}−1)·n in ℕ; reason: cross-multiplied by a positive number; the same pairs (n, f)
--   - reading: a PKI of digital signatures and a SigT environment (§2) → symbolic terms `sig q t` and `tok q i t`, which cannot be forged and whose contents can be read; corrupt parties send any term derivable from all traffic of correct parties and their own keys, with at most one content per corrupt party and token index; reason: the paper's own idealization: its proofs treat a proof of corruption as certain, the theorem has no negligible error term, and §1.2 treats the SigT as a black box
--   - reading: hardware clocks with arbitrary skew and drift before GST and no drift after (p.4) → relative timers: a timer of duration d set at time τ fires in [τ, max(τ, GST) + d], and exactly at τ + d when τ ≥ GST; reason: this contains every clock behaviour the paper allows, and Algorithms 1 and 2 use only relative waits
--   - reading: executions in real time, with “received by time τ” (pp.4, 24) → a sequence of events indexed by ℕ with non-decreasing, unbounded real times; simultaneous events are ordered by the adversary, except that a timer of a correct party firing at τ is handled after the deliveries to it at τ of messages sent before the timer event; reason: “by time τ” means available at τ (p.24 uses this for the Wait 2∆); without the exception an adversary who delivers exactly at the deadline can make a correct leader miss a suggest in every view it leads, and Lemma 4.21 would fail for the printed protocol
--   - generalization: a message reaches its destination; the adversary controls the corrupt parties (p.4) → the adversary also sees every message a correct party sends, may deliver a message of a correct party several times within the model's bounds, and may fire a timer several times inside its window; reason: every execution of the paper's model is an execution here, so the statement covers more executions
--   - reading: Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 as pseudocode (pp.14–18) → the event handler `kSigT`: “received” means occurring in a term the party holds, including its own messages; “any”/“a” choices are made by a fixed choice function; a SigT use blocks the layer rules until the reply; a party forwards each received term once and, after deciding, ignores all events; reason: the pseudocode leaves these points open and the paper's arguments do not depend on them
--   - reading: “Statements about a layer i assume its input conditions” (p.18) → the statement is about every execution of the whole protocol (Algorithm 1 running every layer), with no input conditions as hypotheses; reason: the input conditions hold in every layer of such an execution, by Lemma 4.23 and the paragraph after it (p.25); “m exists in E” is defined for executions of the protocol (p.15)
--   - reading: “receives a valid V2 certificate” → receives each message of such a certificate, possibly inside other terms; reason: a party assembles certificates from the messages it holds (p.26)

**Formalization Note.** The standing hypotheses are those of the analysis (p.18): `k ≥ 1`,
`f < (2^{k+1}−1)n/(2^{k+2}−1)` (cross-multiplied in `ℕ`), `Δ > 0`, an `f`-bounded corrupt set `F`,
`GST ≥ 0`, and an execution `E` of the k-SigT protocol `kSigT n f k Δ` (Algorithm 1), in which the
input conditions of every layer hold (Lemma 4.23). Receiving a certificate is receiving each of its messages. -/
